VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability (CWE-476) 
EXPLANATION:
The `llhttp_settings_t` struct contains two `NULL` pointers as the last two members. These pointers may be used as function pointers or as pointers to data within the struct.  If these pointers are used in any part of the code, it can lead to a null pointer dereference, which can crash or freeze the application, and potentially lead to code execution or data corruption vulnerabilities.  Although they are currently set to NULL, this code could potentially be extended to utilize these fields in the future with actual function pointers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the NULL values with valid function pointers or ensure the function pointers are properly validated before they are used to prevent null pointer dereferences. Alternatively, these fields could be explicitly commented and left NULL, making it clear their current unused state.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
extern int wasm_on_status(llhttp_t* p, const char* at, size_t length);
extern int wasm_on_header_field(llhttp_t* p, const char* at, size_t length);
extern int wasm_on_header_value(llhttp_t* p, const char* at, size_t length);
extern int wasm_on_headers_complete(llhttp_t * p);
extern int wasm_on_body(llhttp_t* p, const char* at, size_t length);
extern int wasm_on_message_complete(llhttp_t * p);

const llhttp_settings_t wasm_settings = {
  wasm_on_message_begin,
  wasm_on_url,
  wasm_on_status,
  wasm_on_header_field,
  wasm_on_header_value,
  wasm_on_headers_complete,
  wasm_on_body,
  wasm_on_message_complete,
  NULL,
  NULL,
};
