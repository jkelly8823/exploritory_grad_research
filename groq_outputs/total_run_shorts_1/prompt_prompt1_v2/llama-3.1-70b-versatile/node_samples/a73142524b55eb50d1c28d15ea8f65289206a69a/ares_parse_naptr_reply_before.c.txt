VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a C program handling DNS responses. It checks the class and type of a DNS resource record to determine if it's a NAPTR record. The logic is straightforward and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
          status = ARES_EBADRESP;
          break;
        }

      /* Check if we are really looking at a NAPTR record */
      if (rr_class == C_IN && rr_type == T_NAPTR)
        {

  return ARES_SUCCESS;
}
```
