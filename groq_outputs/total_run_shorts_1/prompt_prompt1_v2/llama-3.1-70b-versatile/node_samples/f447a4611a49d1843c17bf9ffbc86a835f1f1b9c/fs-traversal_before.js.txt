VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The `traversalPath` and `traversalFolderPath` variables are constructed by concatenating a user-controlled input (`allowedFolder`) with a relative path. This allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive files outside of the intended directory structure by manipulating the `allowedFolder` variable. The use of `../` in the path can be used to traverse up the directory tree and access files or directories that are not intended to be accessible. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to construct file paths. Here are some recommended fixes:
- Use a path sanitization library to normalize and validate file paths.
- Avoid concatenating user-controlled input with file paths.
- Use absolute paths instead of relative paths to prevent directory traversal.
- Validate and restrict the input values for `allowedFolder` to prevent directory traversal.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
const traversalPath = allowedFolder + '../file.md';
const traversalFolderPath = allowedFolder + '../folder';
const bufferTraversalPath = Buffer.from(allowedFolder + '../file.md');

{
  assert.ok(process.permission.has('fs.read', allowedFolder));
  assert.ok(process.permission.has('fs.write', allowedFolder));
}

{
  assert.ok(!process.permission.has('fs.read', traversalPath));
  assert.ok(!process.permission.has('fs.write', traversalPath));
  assert.ok(!process.permission.has('fs.read', traversalFolderPath));
```
