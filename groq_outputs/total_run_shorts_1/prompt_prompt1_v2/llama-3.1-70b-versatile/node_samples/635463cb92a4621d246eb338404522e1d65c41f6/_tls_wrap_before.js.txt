VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Information Exposure through Error Messages

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to information exposure through error messages. The `this.authorizationError` variable is assigned the `verifyError.code` or `verifyError.message` without proper sanitization. This can potentially leak sensitive information about the server or the server's configuration, since the error code or message may contain internal implementation details.

The code does not properly handle the error messages and instead assigns them directly to the `authorizationError` property, making it accessible to other parts of the code or possibly even external users. This can lead to unintended information disclosure, potentially giving an attacker additional data to exploit or use in further attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always sanitize error messages before logging or displaying them.
- Use a generic error message instead of passing on the original error code or message.
- Consider implementing an error handling strategy that abstracts away sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
this.authorized = false;
this.authorizationError = verifyError.code || verifyError.message;

if (options.rejectUnauthorized) {
  this.destroy(verifyError);
  return;
}
debug('client emit secureConnect. rejectUnauthorized: %s, ' +
signal: options.signal,
});

tlssock[kConnectOptions] = options;

if (cb)
  tlssock.once('secureConnect', cb);
```
