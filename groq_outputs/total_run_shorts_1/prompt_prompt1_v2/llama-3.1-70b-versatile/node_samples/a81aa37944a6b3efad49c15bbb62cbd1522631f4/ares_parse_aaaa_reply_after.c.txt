VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of error handling or cleanup code. It involves pointer arithmetic and memory deallocation. However, I have not detected any obvious vulnerabilities in this snippet. The pointer arithmetic is bounded by available values, and memory deallocation functions appear to be correctly called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, no specific recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary. However, it's essential to consider the broader context in which this code is used to ensure that pointer values are valid and properly initialized when passed to these functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
  if (naddrttls)
    {
      /* Truncated to at most *naddrttls entries */
      *naddrttls = (naddrs > *naddrttls)?*naddrttls:naddrs;
    }

  ares__freeaddrinfo_cnames(ai.cnames);
  ares__freeaddrinfo_nodes(ai.nodes);
```
