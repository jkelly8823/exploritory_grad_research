VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of error handling or memory management for DNS address resolution. It truncates the number of address TTLs (*naddrttls) if it exceeds the available addresses (naddrs) and then frees memory allocated for address info. The operations seem to be within expected bounds, and no clear vulnerabilities were identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations for vulnerability fixes are needed as none were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (naddrttls)
  {
    /* Truncated to at most *naddrttls entries */
    *naddrttls = (naddrs > *naddrttls)?*naddrttls:naddrs;
  }

ares__freeaddrinfo_cnames(ai.cnames);
ares__freeaddrinfo_nodes(ai.nodes);
```
