VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
After thorough analysis, this code snippet appears to be a unit test written in Python for the IDLE shell. The code does not manipulate or process any untrusted data that could be used in an attack. It is also isolated within a testing context and does not directly interact with external systems or networks. The used libraries, especially tkinter, do not indicate any obvious security issues in this specific use case. All lines of the code snippet are used in a controlled and deterministic way.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations are needed. The code seems to follow good testing practices and does not demonstrate any potential security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
import unittest
import unittest.mock
from test.support import requires, swap_attr
from test import support
import tkinter as tk
from idlelib.idle_test.tkinter_testing_utils import run_in_tk_mainloop

from idlelib.delegator import Delegator

    @run_in_tk_mainloop()
    def test_very_long_wrapped_line(self):
        with support.adjust_int_max_str_digits(11_111), \
                swap_attr(self.shell, 'squeezer', None):
            self.do_input('x = ' + '1'*10_000 + '\n')
            yield
            self.assertEqual(self.get_sidebar_lines(), ['>>>'])
