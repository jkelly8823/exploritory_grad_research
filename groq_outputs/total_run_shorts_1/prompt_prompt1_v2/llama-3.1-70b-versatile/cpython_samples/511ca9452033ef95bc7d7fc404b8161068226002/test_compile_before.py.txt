VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Evaluator-Injection Vulnerability, specifically Untrusted Input in eval()

EXPLANATION:
The given code uses the built-in `eval()` function to evaluate strings as Python expressions. This is dangerous as it may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. In this specific case, the input is hardcoded and does not pose a direct threat. However, using `eval()` is generally discouraged for untrusted or variable inputs as it can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using `eval()`, use a safer alternative that achieves the same functionality without the risks. For this specific code, you can directly write the octal literals or convert them manually.

```python
self.assertEqual(0o777, 511)
self.assertEqual(-0o10, -8)
```
 
Alternatively, if the input is truly dynamic and needs to be evaluated, consider using the `ast.literal_eval()` function, which is safer and handles only a subset of Python literals. However, `ast.literal_eval()` does not handle octal literals.

```python
import ast
self.assertEqual(int("777", 8), 511)
self.assertEqual(-int("10", 8), -8)
```
 
In cases where you must evaluate more complex expressions and `ast.literal_eval()` is insufficient, consider a more comprehensive alternative like `numexpr` or `asteval`, which are designed to evaluate mathematical expressions safely.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
self.assertEqual(eval("0o777"), 511)
self.assertEqual(eval("-0o0000010"), -8)
