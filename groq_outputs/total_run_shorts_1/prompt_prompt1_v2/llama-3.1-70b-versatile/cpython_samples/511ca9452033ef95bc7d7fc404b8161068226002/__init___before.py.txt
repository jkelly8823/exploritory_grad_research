VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet only contains timing-related operations and does not seem to interact with external data or execute sensitive commands. The sleep function is used with a dynamically generated delay, but as long as the delay value remains within the allowed limits, there is no obvious vulnerability present in these two lines.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
time.sleep(delay)
delay = min(delay * 2, max_delay)
