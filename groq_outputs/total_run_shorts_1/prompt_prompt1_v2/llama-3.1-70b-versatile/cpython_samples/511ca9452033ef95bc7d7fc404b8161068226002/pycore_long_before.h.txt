VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No known vulnerabilities were found in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
I analyzed the provided code snippet, which includes standard C includes, an extern function declaration, and comments. The code does not perform any dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, or execute any user-supplied input. It does not contain any obvious logic errors or resource leaks. The function declaration specifies the return type as PyStatus, which implies that the function is designed to handle potential errors, but no vulnerabilities can be inferred directly from this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: No recommendations are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were found in the code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include "pycore_global_objects.h"  // _PY_NSMALLNEGINTS
#include "pycore_runtime.h"       // _PyRuntime

/* runtime lifecycle */

extern PyStatus _PyLong_InitTypes(PyInterpreterState *);
