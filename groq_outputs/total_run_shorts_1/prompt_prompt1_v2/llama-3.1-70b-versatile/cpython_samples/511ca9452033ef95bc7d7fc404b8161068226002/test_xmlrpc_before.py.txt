VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Transport: Using an unsecured transport for XML-RPC
EXPLANATION:
The code is using the `xmlrpc.client.Transport` class without specifying any authentication or encryption. This can lead to data being transmitted in plain text, exposing it to eavesdropping attacks. Additionally, the `Transport` class may be vulnerable to attacks such as XML parsing vulnerabilities or abuse of XML-RPC's remote procedure call capabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure transport mechanism: Consider using `xmlrpc.client.SafeTransport` instead, which uses HTTPS to encrypt the data.
2. Authenticate and authorize: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only trusted clients can access the XML-RPC endpoint.
3. Validate input: Verify the format and contents of the `get_host_info` method input to prevent potential XML-based attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    check('<bigdecimal>9876543210.0123456789</bigdecimal>',
          decimal.Decimal('9876543210.0123456789'))
