VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 40-41
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The hardcoded data dictionary `sim_users` may pose a vulnerability as the passwords (although obscured, they appear as names) could potentially be used for authentication or in a similar manner that could be exploited by an attacker if this code were to be deployed in production or an attack-prone environment.
EXPLANATION:
While this specific snippet does not explicitly contain a login function that uses the `sim_users` dictionary for authentication, the presence of this dictionary may still pose a vulnerability as it could potentially be used elsewhere in the codebase or by an attacker if the code were to be compromised. Hardcoding sensitive information such as credentials or weakly obscured data like these 'passwords' may allow an attacker to use this data if the codebase or server is compromised.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the `sim_users` dictionary with dynamically generated test data or, better yet, integrate your test suite with your application's user authentication mechanism to ensure secure, role-based access. Use environment variables or a secrets manager for sensitive information such as credentials.
