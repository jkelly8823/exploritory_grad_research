VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9, 13-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
CFR (Carriage Return-Only) and CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the way that `conn.putrequest` is called without properly validating the host and url. By using a payload that includes a carriage return (`\r`) or a combination of a carriage return and a newline (`\r\n`), an attacker could inject unauthorized headers or control data.

In the `test_putrequest_override_host_validation` function, a malicious connection object is created with a domain name that includes a newline (`\r\n`). Although this is an "unsafe" connection object and may be intended to simulate malicious behavior, it still demonstrates the potential vulnerability.

Additionally, the `test_putrequest_override_domain_validation` function calls `putrequest` with a URL that includes a null character (`\x00`), which is also not properly validated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to implement proper validation for hosts, URLs, and user-input data to prevent injection attacks. Some recommendations include:
- Validate user input for hosts and URLs using whitelisting techniques to prevent malicious characters and injection attacks.
-Implement proper null character checking to prevent errors and vulnerabilities.
-Consider using safe methods or functions for handling URL encoding to prevent encoding vulnerabilities.
