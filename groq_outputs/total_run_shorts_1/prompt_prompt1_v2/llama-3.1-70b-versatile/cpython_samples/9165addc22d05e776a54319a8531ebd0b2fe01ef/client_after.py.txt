VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, no apparent vulnerabilities were detected. The code appears to be handling host validation, URL parsing, and request header management in a manner consistent with security best practices. The use of regular expressions to detect control characters in URLs is a good practice for preventing potential vulnerabilities.

The code also raises an InvalidURL exception when encountering control characters in URLs, which is an acceptable way to handle such situations. No signs of injection vulnerabilities, data exposure, or insecure data storage practices were found.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are provided, as the code appears to be secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:

        # tests to replace it with a suitable mockup
        self._create_connection = socket.create_connection

            raise InvalidURL(f"URL can't contain control characters. {url!r} "
                             f"(found at least {match.group()!r})")

    def _validate_host(self, host):
