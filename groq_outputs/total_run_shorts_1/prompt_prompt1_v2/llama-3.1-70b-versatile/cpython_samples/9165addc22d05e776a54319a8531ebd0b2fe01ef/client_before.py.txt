VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 No specific vulnerability found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a class that handles URL and network connections. The functions `_get_hostport` and `putheader` are not shown in this snippet, but there are no obvious security vulnerabilities in the visible code. The handling of the `InvalidURL` exception appears to be proper and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.
 
However, a potential concern is the usage of the `socket.create_connection` function without any validation on the host and port. This function is typically used for establishing connections to a server, but without seeing the complete codebase or usage of this class, it's hard to assess if this is indeed a vulnerability. 

Additionally, in the `putheader` method, the `header` and `values` are directly passed to the server without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially introduce a security vulnerability if the data is not validated before being sent to the server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
In order to fully assess the security of this code snippet, the following recommendations are made:
- Ensure proper validation of the `host` and `port` before establishing a connection to prevent potential network-based attacks.
- Validate and sanitize the `header` and `values` passed to the `putheader` method to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- Review the implementation of the `_get_hostport` method to ensure it properly handles invalid inputs.
- Review the implementation of the `putheader` method to ensure it properly handles invalid inputs.

ORIGINAL CODE:

        (self.host, self.port) = self._get_hostport(host, port)

        # This is stored as an instance variable to allow unit
        # tests to replace it with a suitable mockup
        self._create_connection = socket.create_connection

            raise InvalidURL(f"URL can't contain control characters. {url!r} "
                             f"(found at least {match.group()!r})")

    def putheader(self, header, *values):
        """Send a request header line to the server.

        For example: h.putheader('Accept', 'text/html')
