VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Newline Header Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the `test_url_with_newline_header_injection_rejected` method, the `host` variable is set to a value that contains a newline character and additional HTTP header data. This value is then concatenated with the schemeless URL, potentially leading to a newline header injection vulnerability. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request, which can lead to various types of attacks, including session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other malicious activities. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the newline character in the `host` variable should be sanitized or removed before it is concatenated with the schemeless URL. This can be done using string manipulation functions or by using a URL parsing library that can handle such edge cases. 

The corrected code for line 13 may look like this:

```python
host = "localhost:7777?a=1".replace("\n", "").replace("\r", "")
schemeless_url = "//" + host + ":8080/test/?test=a"
```

Alternatively, instead of trying to manually sanitize the input, it is recommended to use the `urllib.parse` module to parse and construct URLs:

```python
import urllib.parse
...
host = "localhost:7777?a=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123"
schemeless_url = urllib.parse.urlunparse(("", host.split(":")[0], "/test/", "", "", ""))
schemeless_url += "?:8080/test/?test=a"
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
self.unfakehttp()

@unittest.skipUnless(ssl, "ssl module required")
def test_url_with_control_char_rejected(self):
    for char_no in list(range(0, 0x21)) + [0x7f]:
        char = chr(char_no)
        schemeless_url = f"//localhost:7777/test{char}/"
        self.fakehttp(b"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello.")
        self.unfakehttp()

@unittest.skipUnless(ssl, "ssl module required")
def test_url_with_newline_header_injection_rejected(self):
    self.fakehttp(b"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello.")
    host = "localhost:7777?a=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123"
    schemeless_url = "//" + host + ":8080/test/?test=a"
    try:
    finally:
        self.unfakehttp()

def test_read_0_9(self):
    # "0.9" response accepted (but not "simple responses" without
    # a status line)
    self.check_read(b"0.9")
```
