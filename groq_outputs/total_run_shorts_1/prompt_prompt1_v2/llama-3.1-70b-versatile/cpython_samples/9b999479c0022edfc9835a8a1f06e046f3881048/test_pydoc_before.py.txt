VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The `getfile` URL allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the `key` parameter. 

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in lines 7-10 of the provided code snippet. The code constructs a URL for the `getfile` endpoint by directly concatenating the `path` variable, which is derived from the `string.__file__` attribute, with the `getfile?key=` prefix. This makes it possible for an attacker to manipulate the `key` parameter to access files outside of the intended directory. 

For example, if an attacker sets the `key` parameter to `../../../../etc/passwd`, they may be able to read the contents of the system's `/etc/passwd` file. This type of attack is known as a path traversal attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to construct the file path. Here are some recommendations:

- Instead of directly concatenating the `path` variable, use the `path.join()` function to join the directory path with the `key` parameter. This will prevent the `key` parameter from being able to escape the intended directory.
- Use a whitelist of allowed files or directories to prevent access to sensitive system files.
- Validate and sanitize the `key` parameter to prevent it from containing malicious characters or sequences.

ORIGINAL CODE:


        ("topic?key=def", "Pydoc: KEYWORD def"),
        ("topic?key=STRINGS", "Pydoc: TOPIC STRINGS"),
        ("foobar", "Pydoc: Error - foobar"),
        ("getfile?key=foobar", "Pydoc: Error - getfile?key=foobar"),
        ]

    with self.restrict_walk_packages():
        for url, title in requests:
            self.call_url_handler(url, title)

        path = string.__file__
        title = "Pydoc: getfile " + path
        url = "getfile?key=" + path
        self.call_url_handler(url, title)
