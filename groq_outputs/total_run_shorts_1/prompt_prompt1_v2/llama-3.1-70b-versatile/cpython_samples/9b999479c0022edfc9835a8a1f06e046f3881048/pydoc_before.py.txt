VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack due to the use of string formatting with potentially untrusted input. Specifically, the variables `title`, `css_link`, `html_navbar()`, `path`, and `contents` may contain user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `%` operator to format strings, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `title`, `css_link`, `html_navbar()`, `path`, or `contents` variables, which would then be executed by the browser when the HTML page is rendered. Additionally, the `html.escape()` function is used to escape some of the input, but it is not applied consistently throughout the code, leaving some areas vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a template engine or a safer string formatting method, such as `str.format()` or f-strings, and to consistently apply HTML escaping to all user-supplied input. Additionally, consider using a library like `dompurify` to sanitize any user-upplied HTML.
