VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential arbitrary code execution or data exposure vulnerability due to missing validation and sanitization of user-driven data.

EXPLANATION:
The `self.call_url_handler(url, title)` function is called with untrusted input data (`url` and `title`) derived from the `requests` tuple. The `url` variable is directly passed as the first argument to the `self.call_url_handler` function without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the `url` variable to execute arbitrary code, expose sensitive data, or perform unauthorized actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to implement input validation and sanitization on the `url` and `title` variables before passing them to the `self.call_url_handler` function. This can be done by using established library functions or by implementing custom validation and sanitization logic. Additionally, consider using a whitelisting approach to ensure that only expected and predefined URLs are allowed.

Example of a possible fix:
```python
import urllib.parse

# ...

with self.restrict_walk_packages():
    for url, title in requests:
        # Validate and sanitize the URL
        try:
            parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
            if not parsed_url.scheme or not parsed_url.netloc:
                raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
        except ValueError as e:
            # Handle invalid URL error
            print(f"Invalid URL: {e}")
            continue

        # Call the URL handler with validated and sanitized URL
        self.call_url_handler(url, title)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
            ("topic?key=def", "Pydoc: KEYWORD def"),
            ("topic?key=STRINGS", "Pydoc: TOPIC STRINGS"),
            ("foobar", "Pydoc: Error - foobar"),
            ]

        with self.restrict_walk_packages():
            for url, title in requests:
                self.call_url_handler(url, title)


class TestHelper(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_keywords(self):
        self.assertEqual(sorted(pydoc.Helper.keywords),
