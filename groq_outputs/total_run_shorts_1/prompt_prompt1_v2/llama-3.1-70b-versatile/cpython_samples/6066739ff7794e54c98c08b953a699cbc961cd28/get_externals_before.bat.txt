VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
Upon careful analysis of this code snippet, which appears to be a part of a build or installation script written in batch, I did not find any obvious vulnerabilities. The code snippet sets environment variables for a list of libraries and then checks if each library's directory exists.

While this script may pose other issues, such as incorrect path handling or potential errors during the installation of these libraries, the given code does not reveal any observable vulnerabilities within the confines of this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As there are no apparent vulnerabilities detected, no specific recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary. However, a few suggestions for improving code security and reliability can be made:

* Ensure that `EXTERNALS_DIR` is properly sanitized and exists before attempting to access its contents.
* Handle situations where the library is not installed or exists in an invalid state.
* Implement proper error handling for other potential issues during library setup.
