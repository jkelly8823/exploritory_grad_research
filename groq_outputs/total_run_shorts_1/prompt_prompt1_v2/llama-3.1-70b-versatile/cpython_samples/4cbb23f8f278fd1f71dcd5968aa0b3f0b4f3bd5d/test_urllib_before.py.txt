VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improperly formatted NO_PROXY environment variable.
EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the 'NO_PROXY' environment variable is being set with a comma-separated string without proper formatting. The 'NO_PROXY' variable should be set with a comma-separated list, and domain names should not include the protocol scheme (http:// or https://). Furthermore, the domain 'localhost' should be 'localhost.' (with the trailing dot), as 'localhost' is not treated as a valid domain name. However, the risk lies in accidentally adding it without the dot as there is greater uncertainty for security in the other domains. A similar issue arises in potential updates to the field after they leave the development environment and if they are not manually enforced.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The NO_PROXY variable should be set with proper formatting. This could be done like this:

```python
self.env.set('NO_PROXY', 'localhost., anotherdomain.com., .newdomain.com')
```

 Note that we've added a trailing dot (.) at the end of 'localhost' and the other domains if they are not subdomains. Also, be sure that 'localhost' cannot travel over the 'localhost.' domain. These two values should be treated differently as they are very different, with one almost always representing a local server, and the other almost always representing a server not local that someone has setup DNS for. 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
self.env.set('NO_PROXY', 'localhost, anotherdomain.com, newdomain.com')
self.assertTrue(urllib.request.proxy_bypass_environment('anotherdomain.com'))
