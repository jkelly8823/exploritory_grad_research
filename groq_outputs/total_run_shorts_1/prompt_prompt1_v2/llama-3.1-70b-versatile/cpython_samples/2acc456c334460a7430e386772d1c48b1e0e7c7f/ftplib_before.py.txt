VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 27-28
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak and file descriptor leak due to missing `close()` calls.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an FTP client implementation. In the `getline()` method, file-like objects (`conn` and `fp`) are created but not properly closed. Although the `with` statement is used, it's not applied consistently throughout the method. The file-like object `fp` is created inside a loop but its closing is not handled correctly. Additionally, the `close()` method is not explicitly called on the `conn` and `fp` objects in case of exceptions, which can lead to resource leaks and file descriptor leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that all file-like objects are properly closed. In this case, `conn` and `fp` objects should be closed in a `finally` block to handle exceptions.
2. Use a `try-finally` block to close the file-like objects, if not using a `with` statement.
3. Apply the `with` statement consistently throughout the `getline()` method to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up.

Here is a corrected version of the vulnerable lines:

```python
def getline(self):
    line = self.file.readline()
    if self.debugging > 1:
        print('*get*', self.sanitize(line))
    if not line:
        raise EOFError
    with self.transfercmd(cmd) as conn:
        with conn.makefile('r', encoding=self.encoding) as fp:
            while 1:
                line = fp.readline()
                if self.debugging > 2:
                    print('*retr*', repr(line))
                if not line:
                    break
    with self.transfercmd(cmd) as conn:
        try:
            while 1:
                buf = conn.readline()
                if not buf:
                    break
                if buf[-2:] != B_CRLF:
                    if buf[-1] in B_CRLF: buf = buf[:-1]
        except Exception:
            pass  # handle exceptions
        finally:
            conn.close()  # close conn in a finally block
```

    # Raise EOFError if the connection is closed
    def getline(self):
        line = self.file.readline()
        if self.debugging > 1:

        self.voidcmd('TYPE A')
        with self.transfercmd(cmd) as conn:
