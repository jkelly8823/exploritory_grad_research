VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Data Handling with FTP Data Transfer
EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, the FTP data transfer protocol (DTP) is used to transfer data between the client and server. However, there is a potential vulnerability in the collect_incoming_data method. If the rest attribute is not an integer, it may cause an exception when trying to convert it to an integer. This exception could be leveraged by an attacker to conduct an FTP server side resource exhaustion attack or potentially inject malicious code.

Additionally, the RETR_DATA variable seems to be unchecked and can potentially contain user-supplied input. If not properly sanitized, this can lead to buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.

Lastly, using MLSD_DATA in an unchecked manner in cmd_list can also lead to malicious commands like directory traversal attacks. This is especially concerning because file operations could inadvertently reveal sensitive information from the system hosting the FTP server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, several steps can be taken.

- Validate and sanitize the rest attribute to ensure it can be successfully converted into an integer. Implement try/except blocks around integer conversions to handle any issues that may occur.

- Use safe methods to parse and retrieve data, implementing string checking and limit input lengths when parsing FTP data.

- Implement buffer overflow protection to prevent RETR_DATA from exceeding maximum allowed size limits.

- Always sanitize and verify user input to prevent malicious commands.

- In order to limit the severity of potential risks and harden the FTP server further, ensure that the server's running environment has strict authentication controls and access restriction policies.

        self.dtp.push(RETR_DATA[offset:])
        self.dtp.close_when_done()
        self.rest = None

        self.dtp.push(MLSD_DATA)
