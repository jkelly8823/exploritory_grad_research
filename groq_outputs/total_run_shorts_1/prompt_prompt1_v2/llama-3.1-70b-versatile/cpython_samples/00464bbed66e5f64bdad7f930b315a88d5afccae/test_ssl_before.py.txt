VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a unit test for Python's ssl module. It tests various error scenarios, such as missing certificate files, invalid certificate usage, and connection errors in server-side mode. The code uses the ssl.wrap_socket function, which handles SSL/TLS encryption, and raises exceptions as expected in error scenarios. However, no obvious vulnerabilities or security issues were found in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
