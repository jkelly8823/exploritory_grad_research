VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of Hardcoded or Custom Security Protocols

EXPLANATION:
The provided code sets the sslobject_class in SSLContext to SSLObject. However, there is no indication that SSLObject is a secure, tested, and widely accepted class for handling SSL connections. Hardcoding or customly implementing security protocols without careful testing and validation can introduce vulnerabilities.

Given the context, this should likely be set to the secure protocols supported by the SSL library (e.g., ssl._create_stdlib_context is used in many cases to create a default high level secure context using the standard library SSL), not some arbitrary class.

However, it is crucial to consider that custom protocol implementations in high-security code can sometimes be justified for specific requirements.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Using widely accepted and tested security protocols and classes from a well-known library is advised if there is no specific requirement for custom implementation.

Consider replacing with code such as:
```python
import ssl
SSLContext = ssl._create_stdlib_context()
# other operations might work on this SSLContext
```
The hard-coded/external class, "SSLObject" could also be validated for vulnerabilities depending on where it originated.

For direct access, if SSLObject provides well-documented and secure protocols that satisfy high-security requirements. For auditable purposes the code might benefit from being referenced as acceptable to any related regulations and compliance standard

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
SSLContext.sslobject_class = SSLObject


# some utility functions

def cert_time_to_seconds(cert_time):
    """Return the time in seconds since the Epoch, given the timestring 
```
