VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is written in XML and is a configuration file for a Python extension. It defines tags for the DLL name and PydTag for different architectures. The code does not contain any dynamic data or input that could lead to a vulnerability. It only uses static variables and does not perform any operations that could lead to a vulnerability. This code snippet is not responsible for any vulnerability in this case.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
    <!-- The name of the resulting pythonXY.dll (without the extension) -->
    <PyDllName>python$(MajorVersionNumber)$(MinorVersionNumber)$(PyDebugExt)</PyDllName>

    <!-- The version and platform tag to include in .pyd filenames -->
    <PydTag Condition="$(ArchName) == 'win32'">.cp$(MajorVersionNumber)$(MinorVersionNumber)-win32</PydTag>
    <PydTag Condition="$(ArchName) == 'arm32'">.cp$(MajorVersionNumber)$(MinorVersionNumber)-win_arm32</PydTag>
