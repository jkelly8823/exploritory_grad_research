VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 63, 67, 71, 75, 89-90
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Server-side request forgery (SSRF) and possible information disclosure via unsanitized server names in SSLContext.
EXPLANATION:
The presented code is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) and possible information disclosure due to the server name being set from user-controlled data. Specifically, lines 63, 67, 71, and 75 are affected, where the server names are set to 'localhost'. However, these are passed directly from the user, making them vulnerable to SSRF attacks. Furthermore, lines 89-90 can be mitigated by properly validating the server name.

Additionally, in test_preauth_data_to_tls_client() function, if call_after_accept has an opportunity to be tampered with on the server thread, or if the call to `conn_to_client.send` within it can be manipulated, an unsanitized HTTP request body could be captured by this line. However, since the original request data in `conn_to_client.send` contains `307 Temporary Redirect` message, potential SSRF here is extremely constrained.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the server names passed to the ssl_ctx object. Only allow trusted server names to mitigate SSRF attacks.

Here's an example of how the server validation can be implemented:

```python
def validate_server_name(server_name):
    allowed_servers = ['localhost', 'your.trusted.server', 'another.trusted.server']
    if server_name in allowed_servers:
        return True
    else:
        # Return security error or use an alternative server
        return False

# Example usage:
server_name = 'localhost'
if validate_server_name(server_name):
    ssl_ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
    try:
        tls_client = ssl_ctx.wrap_socket(client, server_hostname=server_name)
    except OSError as err:
        wrap_error = err
    else:
        wrap_error = None
else:
    # return proper error, possibly alternative action, etc.
    sec_error = True

```

2.  Verify  all types of incoming HTTP traffic from internal or even more preferably internal trusted links, in a production environment take extra precautionary steps like - 
add more HTTP filters if necessary 
 - Limit possible HTTP routes.
 - make certain any 'hidden' routes would either be - 
a)   Not necessary
b)   set up deliberately
c)   at-the-very-least  well protected.

3.  Enable logging (with security on logs).

4.  Note that the best long-term strategies include having multi-level security for each server with individualized system security all under policy-driven authentication-verification.
