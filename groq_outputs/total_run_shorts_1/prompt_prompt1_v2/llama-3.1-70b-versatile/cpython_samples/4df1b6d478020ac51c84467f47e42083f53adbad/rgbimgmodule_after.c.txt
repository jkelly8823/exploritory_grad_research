VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability occurs due to the potential integer overflow in the line `rlebuflen = (int) (1.05 * xsize + 10);`. In this line, the multiplication and addition operations can result in a floating-point number that exceeds the maximum limit of an integer. When this value is cast to an integer, it can cause an integer overflow, resulting in undefined behavior.

Additionally, the variable `xsize` is multiplied by 1.05, which can result in a large value. If `xsize` is close to the maximum limit of an integer, this multiplication can also cause an integer overflow. 

Furthermore, in the line `tablen = ysize * zsize * sizeof(Py_Int32);`, there is no validation to check for overflow before calculating `tablen`. This can result in an integer overflow if `ysize` or `zsize` is large, causing undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following steps can be taken:

* Before multiplying `xsize` by 1.05, validate that the result will not overflow the integer range.
* Use a safer method to calculate `rlebuflen`, such as using a library function that handles overflow checks.
* Validate the result of the multiplication in the line `tablen = ysize * zsize * sizeof(Py_Int32);` to prevent integer overflow.

Here is an example of how this code could be modified to prevent integer overflows:

```c
rlebuflen = xsize + (int) (xsize * 0.05);
if (rlebuflen > INT_MAX - 10) {
    PyErr_NoMemory();
    goto finally;
}
rlebuflen += 10;

// and

tablen = ysize * zsize * sizeof(Py_Int32);
if (tablen < 0 || (ysize * zsize > tablen / sizeof(Py_Int32))) {
    PyErr_NoMemory();
    goto finally;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
xsize = image.xsize;
ysize = image.ysize;
zsize = image.zsize;
tablen = xsize * ysize * zsize * sizeof(Py_Int32);
if (xsize != (((tablen / ysize) / zsize) / sizeof(Py_Int32))) {
    PyErr_NoMemory();
    goto finally;
}
if (rle) {
    tablen = ysize * zsize * sizeof(Py_Int32);
    rlebuflen = (int) (1.05 * xsize +10);
    if ((tablen / sizeof(Py_Int32)) != (ysize * zsize) ||
