VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: OS Command Injection via Untrusted Environment Variable
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to an OS command injection attack via the 'REQUEST_METHOD' environment variable, which is checked to determine if the script is running as a CGI. If an attacker can manipulate the environment variable 'REQUEST_METHOD', they could potentially inject malicious commands. However, this vulnerability may be limited by the fact that the only operation performed based on this variable is popping an item from a dictionary.
 
Additionally, the 'proxies' dictionary is populated based on environment variables. These variables may be set by untrusted sources if the script is running as a CGI or if the environment variables are otherwise manipulated by an attacker. This could potentially lead to an attacker setting a proxy, allowing them to intercept traffic.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize environment variables before using them in the code.
2. Instead of relying solely on the presence of 'REQUEST_METHOD' environment variable to determine if the script is running as a CGI, consider using more robust methods.
3. Use a whitelist of trusted proxy settings instead of allowing any environment variable to set the proxy.
 
ORIGINAL CODE:
    name = name.lower()
    if value and name[-6:] == '_proxy':
        proxies[name[:-6]] = value

    # CVE-2016-1000110 - If we are running as CGI script, forget HTTP_PROXY
    # (non-all-lowercase) as it may be set from the web server by a "Proxy:"
    # header from the client
    if 'REQUEST_METHOD' in os.environ:
        proxies.pop('http', None)

    return proxies
