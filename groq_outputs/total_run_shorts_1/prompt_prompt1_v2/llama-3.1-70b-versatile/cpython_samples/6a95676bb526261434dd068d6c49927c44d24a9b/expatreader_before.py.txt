VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential unhandled exception vulnerability when calling the `fatalError` method and when handling the file operations in the `_close_source` method.

EXPLANATION:
The `_close_source` method properly handles exceptions using a `try` block. However, the call to `fatalError` is not wrapped in a `try-except` block, which could cause an unhandled exception if `self._err_handler.fatalError(exc)` raises another exception. 

Additionally, the comment `# FIXME: when to invoke error()?` suggests that there's unfinished work regarding error handling. 

The potential unhandled exception in the `self._err_handler.fatalError(exc)` call could be handled by wrapping it in a `try-except` block. However, since it's being handled inside the comment, we can't immediately execute.

However there's an opportunity to raise the awareness about the issue related to error handling and implementation, it can be a problem.

Furthermore the code assumes that `source.getCharacterStream()` does not throw an exception. This is a potential issue, as `getCharacterStream()` might return `None` or raise a different exception when the file is already closed or the underlying source is exhausted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Wrap the `self._err_handler.fatalError(exc)` call in a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that might be raised by this method call.
- It would be good to provide some checking on `source.getCharacterStream()` to make sure it doesn't raise an exception or doesn't return `None`.
- Resolving and adjusting the comment regarding errors implementation and how these occur can be a good next step.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
# FIXME: when to invoke error()?
self._err_handler.fatalError(exc)

def _close_source(self):
    source = self._source
    try:
        file = source.getCharacterStream()
```
