VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `getline` method (and multiple other methods in the snippet) reads a line from the server with a maximum size defined by the `maxline` parameter. However, it does not handle the case where the line is exactly equal to `maxline + 1` characters long. This can lead to a buffer overflow when processing the line. The code assumes that a line will either be shorter than `maxline + 1` characters or will have a single character following `maxline` characters. However, in practice, many FTP servers do not follow this convention and may respond with longer lines.

Additionally, there are multiple usages of `readline(self.maxline + 1)` across different parts of the code. This repetition can lead to inconsistencies if `maxline` is updated in the future.

The CRLF handling logic in the code can also be improved. It checks for both CRLF and CR (when CRLF is truncated to a single CR) at multiple places, which seems redundant.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using a more robust method to handle the `getline` functionality such as using `while` loop to continuously read chunks of data and accumulate the line until it ends with a CRLF sequence.
- Update CRLF handling to handle it consistently across the entire class.
- Use named constants for line termination sequences instead of relying on a specific separator string to increase readability and maintainability.
- Use exception handling to catch and process cases where the readline fails and results in an unexpected outcome.
