VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Data Processing.

EXPLANATION:
The command 'cmd_setlongretr' allows a user to set the length of the next 'RETR' command's data via the 'arg' parameter. This 'arg' is directly converted to an integer and used to construct a large string of 'x' characters, which is then assigned to 'self.next_retr_data'. There is no validation on the length of 'arg', allowing a user to cause a denial of service by setting 'arg' to a very large value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the 'arg' parameter to ensure it is a reasonable length before constructing 'self.next_retr_data'.
- Consider adding error checking when constructing 'self.next_retr_data' to prevent excessive memory usage.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def cmd_setlongretr(self, arg):
    # For testing. Next RETR will return long line.
    self.next_retr_data = 'x' * int(arg)
    self.push('125 setlongretr ok')
```
