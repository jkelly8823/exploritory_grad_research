EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be setting environment variables and conditionally appending additional libraries to the "libraries" variable based on the values of certain flags. It does not handle or process any user input, nor does it perform any actions that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities such as directory traversal, command injection, or buffer overflow. 
There do not appear to be any security vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations are needed.
