VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Default Verification Mode and Insufficient Certificate Validation
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sets the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_NONE by default. This is a vulnerable configuration as it doesn't verify the identity of the peer, which can lead to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Even when the verification mode is set to SSL_VERIFY_PEER, only the existence of the certificate is checked, but its validity (e.g., expiration date, CN/SAN matching) is not thoroughly validated. Furthermore, certificate mismatch warnings are also not handled properly, potentially leading to an insecure connection.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always set the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.
2. Properly set the list of trusted certificates using SSL_CTX_set_cert_store or load_verify_locations to avoid connecting to unknown or malicious servers.
3. Implement certificate validation for common issues like expiration date, CN/SAN matching, and warnings for certificate mismatches.
4. Consider enabling additional verification flags such as SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT to prevent connections with unknown or unsigned certificates.
