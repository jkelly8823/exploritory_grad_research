VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No known vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. The function appears to be implementing a utility to convert DNS names to patterns for matching. The code processes DNS name fragments and constructs a pattern using a list of strings.

The only potentially malicious input is the '*' character, which is handled specifically to match a non-empty dotless fragment. There is no evidence of unsanitized user input or usage of potentially vulnerable functions.

Keep in mind that this assessment is limited to the provided code snippet and does not consider the broader context of the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
pass


def _dnsname_to_pat(dn):
    pats = []
    for frag in dn.split(r'.'):
        if frag == '*':
            # When '*' is a fragment by itself, it matches a non-empty dotless
            # fragment.
            pats.append('[^.]+')
```
