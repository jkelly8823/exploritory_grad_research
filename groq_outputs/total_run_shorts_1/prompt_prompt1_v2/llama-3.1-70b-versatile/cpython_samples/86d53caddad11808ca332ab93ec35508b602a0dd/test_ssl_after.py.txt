VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a test suite for the `ssl` module in Python, specifically testing the `match_hostname` function. It tests various scenarios, including invalid certificates and certificates with multiple wildcards. The tests are designed to verify that the function raises the expected errors in these scenarios.

No obvious security vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet. The tests appear to be correctly written and do not contain any suspicious or insecure code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
self.assertRaises(ValueError, ssl.match_hostname, None, 'example.com')
self.assertRaises(ValueError, ssl.match_hostname, {}, 'example.com')

# Issue #17980: avoid denials of service by refusing more than one
# wildcard per fragment.
cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'a*b.com'),),)}
ok(cert, 'axxb.com')
cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'a*b.co*'),),)}
ok(cert, 'axxb.com')
cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'a*b*.com'),),)}
with self.assertRaises(ssl.CertificateError) as cm:
    ssl.match_hostname(cert, 'axxbxxc.com')
self.assertIn("too many wildcards", str(cm.exception))

def test_server_side(self):
    # server_hostname doesn't work for server sockets
