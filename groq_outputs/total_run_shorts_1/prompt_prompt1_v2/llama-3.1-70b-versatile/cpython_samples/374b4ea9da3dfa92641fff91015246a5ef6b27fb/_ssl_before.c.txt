VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is related to insecure SSL verification mode. The code sets the SSL verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_NONE and only changes it to SSL_VERIFY_PEER if the certreq is set to PY_SSL_CERT_OPTIONAL. However, in many cases, a server certificate is still required to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. When the certreq is not set to PY_SSL_CERT_OPTIONAL, the validation mode remains at SSL_VERIFY_NONE, allowing an attacker to intercept the SSL connection.

EXPLANATION:
The code sets the SSL verification mode based on the value of certreq. If certreq is not PY_SSL_CERT_OPTIONAL, the verification mode remains at SSL_VERIFY_NONE, allowing a server certificate to be missing, unsigned, or invalid without any error or warning. This allows an attacker to intercept the SSL connection and steal sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended solution is to set the default verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER instead of SSL_VERIFY_NONE. If the server certificate is not required, use a different secure verification mode, such as SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT. It is also recommended to check the return value of SSL_CTX_set_options to ensure that the options were set successfully. Additionally, consider setting the SSL version explicitly to avoid using weaker protocols.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    }

    /* ssl compatibility */
    SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_ALL);

    verification_mode = SSL_VERIFY_NONE;
    if (certreq == PY_SSL_CERT_OPTIONAL)
        verification_mode = SSL_VERIFY_PEER;
