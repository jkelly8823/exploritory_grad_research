VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Server Configuration: Sensitive Functionality Exposed Over HTTP
EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, I identified a vulnerability related to the usage of HTTP (unencrypted) instead of HTTPS (encrypted) for XML-RPC communication and HTTP connection. Communication over HTTP can expose sensitive information and make it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Using HTTPS would ensure encryption and secure transmission of data.

Specifically, the vulnerability is present in these two lines of code:
- server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://%s:%d/RPC2" % (ADDR, PORT))
- conn = http.client.HTTPConnection(ADDR, PORT)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for communication. Here is the recommended fix:
- Replace the 'http' with 'https' in the XML-RPC URL. Ensure that SSL certificates are properly configured on the XML-RPC server to avoid errors.
- For HTTP connection, use HTTPS and consider using sslcontext (as mentioned here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html) if there's a valid reason for not migrating from an HTTP client to an HTTPS client.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def tearDown(self):
    # wait on the server thread to terminate
    self.evt.wait()

    # disable traceback reporting
    xmlrpc.server.SimpleXMLRPCServer._send_traceback_header = False

    server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://%s:%d/RPC2" % (ADDR, PORT))
    self.assertEqual(server.add("a", "\xe9"), "a\xe9")

def test_partial_post(self):
    # Check that a partial POST doesn't make the server loop: issue #14001.
    conn = http.client.HTTPConnection(ADDR, PORT)
    conn.request('POST', '/RPC2 HTTP/1.0\r\nContent-Length: 100\r\n\r\nbye')
    conn.close()
