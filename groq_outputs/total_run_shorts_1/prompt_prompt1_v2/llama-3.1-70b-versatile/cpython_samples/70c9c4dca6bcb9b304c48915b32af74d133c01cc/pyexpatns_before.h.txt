VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of a series of macro definitions. These definitions appear to be renaming functions from the Expat XML parser library. There are no function calls, variable assignments, or other operations that can introduce a vulnerability.

The definitions themselves do not contain any potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format strings, or data leaks. There are no inputs, external data, or dynamic memory allocations in the code.

Considering the context of this snippet, it seems to be part of an interface or wrapper for the Expat library, which does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. However, it is recommended to review the functions being renamed by these macros for any potential vulnerabilities in their implementation.
