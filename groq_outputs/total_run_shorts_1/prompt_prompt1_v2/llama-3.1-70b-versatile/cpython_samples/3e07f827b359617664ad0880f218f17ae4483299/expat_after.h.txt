VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities. It consists of defining version numbers for an XML library and an include guard for C++ compiler. There are no apparent signs of user input sanitization issues, buffer overflow vulnerabilities, or other potential security concerns.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary in this case, as none were identified. However, considering best practices, it might be helpful to add additional documentation or comments that explain how these version numbers are used throughout the codebase.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c

   See http://semver.org.
*/
#define XML_MAJOR_VERSION 2
#define XML_MINOR_VERSION 5
#define XML_MICRO_VERSION 0

#ifdef __cplusplus
