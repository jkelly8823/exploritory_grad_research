VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential security vulnerability due to a missing check for proxy environment variables.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code checks for HTTP proxy environment variables and converts them to lowercase. However, when iterating over the environment variables and checking for proxy variables, it does not verify whether the 'proxies' dictionary already contains a key with the same name. This could potentially lead to incorrect proxy settings being used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, add a check to ensure that duplicate proxy settings are not added to the 'proxies' dictionary. Here's a possible solution:
```python
# ...
for name, value in os.environ.items():
    if name[-6:] == '_proxy' and value:
        lower_name = name.lower()
        if lower_name not in proxies:  # Add this check
            proxies[lower_name[:-6]] = value
```
This change will prevent duplicate proxy settings from being added to the 'proxies' dictionary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
name = name.lower()
if value and name[-6:] == '_proxy':
    proxies[name[:-6]] = value
# CVE-2016-1000110 - If we are running as CGI script, forget HTTP_PROXY
# (non-all-lowercase) as it may be set from the web server by a "Proxy:"
# header from the client
# If "proxy" is lowercase, it will still be used thanks to the next block
if 'REQUEST_METHOD' in os.environ:
    proxies.pop('http', None)
for name, value in os.environ.items():
    if name[-6:] == '_proxy':
        name = name.lower()
        if value:
