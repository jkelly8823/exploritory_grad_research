VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Input Validation Vulnerability - potential for excessive resource consumption.

EXPLANATION:
The readline() function has a hardcoded maximum line length of _MAXLINE (10000 octets). However, it reads up to _MAXLINE + 1 octets from the file. If a malicious user sends a line that is longer than _MAXLINE, the readline() function will still read up to _MAXLINE + 1 octets. This may lead to excessive resource consumption if an attacker sends extremely long lines.

Furthermore, even though a self.error exception is raised if the line length exceeds _MAXLINE, this does not prevent the resource consumption, it simply tells the user what happened.

Additionally, no validation is performed on the data being sent in the send() function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider adding more robust input validation checks, ensuring that data being read from the file and sent over the network do not excessively consume system resources.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks via excessive resource consumption.
- Validate and sanitize the data being sent via the send() function.

# Maximal line length when calling readline(). This is to prevent
# reading arbitrary length lines. RFC 3501 and 2060 (IMAP 4rev1)
# don't specify a line length. RFC 2683 however suggests limiting client
# command lines to 1000 octets and server command lines to 8000 octets.
# We have selected 10000 for some extra margin and since that is supposedly
# also what UW and Panda IMAP does.
_MAXLINE = 10000
