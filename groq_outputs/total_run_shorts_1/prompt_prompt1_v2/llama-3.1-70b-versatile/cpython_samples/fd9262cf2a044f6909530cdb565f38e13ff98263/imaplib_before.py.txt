VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing Input Validation for IMAP4 read and send functions.
EXPLANATION:
We've identified a potential security vulnerability within the given IMAP4 code snippet. The `readline` and `send` functions do not perform any input validation on the received or sent data, respectively. This lack of validation leaves the system vulnerable to potential attacks such as buffer overflows or injection attacks.

These functions are directly reading and writing data from/to the `self.file` object without checking their contents. This could lead an attacker to potentially inject malicious data, such as IMAP4 protocol exploit code, allowing them to take control of the IMAP4 connection.

Furthermore, the `readline` function doesn't explicitly handle exceptions. This could lead to system crashes or other errors when handling unexpected input or failures.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate Input**: Ensure that `readline` and `send` functions validate their inputs to prevent potential attacks. Implement input validation and sanitization techniques to handle malicious or unexpected data.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement try/except blocks in the `readline` function to handle and report potential errors.

3. **Input Limitations**: Consider enforcing input limitations to prevent excessively large input that could lead to buffer overflows.

Here's a conceptual representation of what this could look like:
```python
def readline(self):
    try:
        data = self.file.readline()
        # implement input validation
        if not isinstance(data, str) or len(data) > MAX LENGTH:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle and report exception
        raise

def send(self, data):
    # implement input validation
    if not isinstance(data, str):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    return self.file.send(data)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
IMAP4_SSL_PORT = 993
AllowedVersions = ('IMAP4REV1', 'IMAP4')        # Most recent first

#       Commands

Commands = {
        # name            valid states


    def readline(self):
        """Read line from remote."""
        return self.file.readline()


    def send(self, data):
        """Send data to remote."""
```
