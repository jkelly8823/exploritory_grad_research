VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability has been identified in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It defines a list of URL bytes to remove (per WHATWG spec) and contains a function `clear_cache` that replaces these bytes from a URL and scheme string. No user input is directly processed in this code, and there are no apparent memory or data corruption issues, input validation concerns, or resource utilization vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Although no vulnerability has been found, it is essential to consider input validation when processing URLs to prevent any potential issues with the input data. Additionally, avoid directly removing characters using `replace()` method in a loop as it can be inefficient for large strings, as it creates new strings in each iteration. Instead, consider using a single iteration with a regular expression or a list comprehension for performance-critical applications.

Note that this code seems to be a part of a larger codebase and assumes the variables `url` and `scheme` are defined and validated elsewhere.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
from collections import namedtuple
import functools
                '0123456789'
                '+-.')
# Unsafe bytes to be removed per WHATWG spec
_UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE = ['\t', '\r', '\n']

def clear_cache():
    """

    url, scheme, _coerce_result = _coerce_args(url, scheme)

    for b in _UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE:
        url = url.replace(b, "")
        scheme = scheme.replace(b, "")
