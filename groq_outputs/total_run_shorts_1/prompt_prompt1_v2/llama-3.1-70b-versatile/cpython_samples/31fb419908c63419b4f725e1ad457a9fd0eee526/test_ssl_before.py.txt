ORIGINAL CODE:
```
self.assertRaises(ValueError, ssl.match_hostname, None, 'example.com')
self.assertRaises(ValueError, ssl.match_hostname, {}, 'example.com')

def test_server_side(self):
    # server_hostname doesn't work for server sockets
    ctx = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
    with socket.socket() as sock:
```
