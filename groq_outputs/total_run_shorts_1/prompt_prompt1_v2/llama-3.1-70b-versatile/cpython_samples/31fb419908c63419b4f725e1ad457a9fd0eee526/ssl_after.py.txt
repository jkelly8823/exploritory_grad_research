VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be implementing a DNS validation check as part of an SSL certificate verification process. The function `_dnsname_to_pat` seems to be transforming DNS names into regular expression patterns to facilitate validation. 

The code raises a `CertificateError` when more than one wildcard is present in a DNS fragment, preventing potential Denial of Service attacks. This is a reasonable and secure implementation of DNS validation. The function handles potential edge cases correctly, including the presence of a standalone '*' wildcard.

No obvious security vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No security recommendations are necessary for this code.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
pass

def _dnsname_to_pat(dn, max_wildcards=1):
    pats = []
    for frag in dn.split(r'.'):
        if frag.count('*') > max_wildcards:
            # Issue #17980: avoid denials of service by refusing more
            # than one wildcard per fragment.  A survery of established
            # policy among SSL implementations showed it to be a
            # reasonable choice.
            raise CertificateError(
                "too many wildcards in certificate DNS name: " + repr(dn))
        if frag == '*':
            # When '*' is a fragment by itself, it matches a non-empty dotless
            # fragment.
            pats.append('[^.]+')
