VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be a function for converting DNS names to regex patterns. This function correctly handles the '*' character in DNS names, converting it to a regex pattern that matches one or more non-dot characters. The code is well-structured, readable, and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.

Given the snippet provided, there are no potential paths for user input to be evaluated, no external calls, and no potential buffer overflows, which are common sources of security vulnerabilities.

However, as this is a snippet from a larger file, it's always a good idea to look at how this function is being called and if it's handling input from an untrusted source.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommended fixes are required. However, it might be beneficial to include proper error handling if the input 'dn' is not of type string or if it does not adhere to the expected format.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
pass


def _dnsname_to_pat(dn):
    pats = []
    for frag in dn.split(r'.'):
        if frag == '*':
            # When '*' is a fragment by itself, it matches a non-empty dotless
            # fragment.
            pats.append('[^.]+')
```
