VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to incomplete error handling.
EXPLANATION:
The function `load_data` contains an error handling mechanism utilizing labels (`error`, `cleanup`). However, when jumping to `cleanup` directly with a successful initialization (i.e., `goto cleanup;` with `rv = 0`), the code doesn't free the memory allocated for `utcoff` and `dstoff`. In case of failure, the control jumps to `error` where these resources are freed. A potential resource leak might occur when these variables are not freed during successful executions, causing memory leaks.

Additionally, `data_tuple` is initialized as `NULL`, but it is not checked if it was properly allocated/freed before and after being used (likely intended to be used in the omitted code).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure all allocated resources are freed regardless of the initialization status.
  Consider calling `free(utcoff)` and `free(dstoff)` before jumping to `cleanup;` in case of successful initialization.
- Verify if `data_tuple` is properly allocated before using it.
  Add a `Py_DECREF` call to decrease its reference count when it is no longer needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int
load_data(zoneinfo_state *state, PyZoneInfo_ZoneInfo *self, PyObject *file_obj)
{
    PyObject *data_tuple = NULL;

    long *utcoff = NULL;
    long *dstoff = NULL;
        }
    }

    int rv = 0;
    goto cleanup;
error:
    // These resources only need to be freed if we have failed, if we succeed
    // in initializing a PyZoneInfo_ZoneInfo object, we can rely on its dealloc
```
