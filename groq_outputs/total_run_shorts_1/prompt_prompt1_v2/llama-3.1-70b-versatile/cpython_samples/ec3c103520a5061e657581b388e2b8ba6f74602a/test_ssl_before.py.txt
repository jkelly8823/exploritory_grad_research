VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to certificate validation issues due to the loading of certificates from files with unknown or untrusted origins.

EXPLANATION:
Upon reviewing the code snippet, I notice that certificates are being loaded from files without any verification of their authenticity or validity. This is a vulnerability as certificates loaded in such a manner can be tampered with or replaced by malicious actors, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks or other cryptographic attacks. 

More specifically, the certificates named "XXXnonexisting.pem", "badkey.pem", and "nokia.pem" are loaded using the `data_file()` function. Without knowing the origin or trustworthiness of these certificates, it's possible that these certificates may be invalid, tampered with, or malicious.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To remediate this vulnerability, I recommend that the certificates be loaded in a secure manner, such as:

* Verifying the authenticity of certificates before loading them.
* Using trusted certificate authorities to obtain certificates.
* Ensuring that the path to the certificate file is secure and free from tampering.
* Using a secure certificate loading mechanism, such as a trusted certificate store.

Additionally, I recommend adding certificate validation and verification steps to ensure the certificates loaded are trustworthy and authentic.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
WRONGCERT = data_file("XXXnonexisting.pem")
BADKEY = data_file("badkey.pem")
NOKIACERT = data_file("nokia.pem")


def handle_error(prefix):
    exc_format = ' '.join(traceback.format_exception(*sys.exc_info()))
                          ('DNS', 'projects.forum.nokia.com'))
                        )

    def test_DER_to_PEM(self):
        with open(SVN_PYTHON_ORG_ROOT_CERT, 'r') as f:
            pem = f.read()
        d1 = ssl.PEM_cert_to_DER_cert(pem)
        fail(cert, 'foo.a.com')
        fail(cert, 'bar.foo.com')

        # Slightly fake real-world example
        cert = {'notAfter': 'Jun 26 21:41:46 2011 GMT',
                'subject': ((('commonName', 'linuxfrz.org'),),),
                'subjectAltName': (('DNS', 'linuxfr.org'),
