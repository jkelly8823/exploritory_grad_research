VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Transmission of Sensitive Information (Clear Text Authentication)
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses HTTP Basic Auth, which transmits credentials (username and password) as plaintext. This is a security vulnerability, as eavesdroppers can intercept the credentials. Additionally, there is no encryption or hashing mechanism used to protect the passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider using HTTPS (TLS/SSL) instead of HTTP to encrypt the transmission of sensitive information. Additionally, use a more secure authentication mechanism such as Digest Auth, OAuth, or JWT, which provide better security features than Basic Auth.

ORIGINAL CODE:


    # allow for double- and single-quoted realm values
    # (single quotes are a violation of the RFC, but appear in the wild)
    rx = re.compile('(?:.*,)*[ \t]*([^ \t]+)[ \t]+'
                    'realm=(["\']?)([^"\']*)\\2', re.I)

    # XXX could pre-emptively send auth info already accepted (RFC 2617,
    # end of section 2, and section 1.2 immediately after "credentials"
    # production).
        self.passwd = password_mgr
        self.add_password = self.passwd.add_password

        # authority
        # XXX could be multiple headers
        authreq = headers.get(authreq, None)

        if authreq:
            scheme = authreq.split()[0]
