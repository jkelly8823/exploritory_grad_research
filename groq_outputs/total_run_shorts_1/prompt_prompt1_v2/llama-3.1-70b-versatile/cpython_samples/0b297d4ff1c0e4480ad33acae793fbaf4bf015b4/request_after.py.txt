VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure handling of user credentials during HTTP Basic Authentication.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a vulnerability related to the insecure handling of user credentials during HTTP Basic Authentication. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `self.passwd.find_user_password(realm, host)` call in the `retry_http_basic_auth` method returns a password in plain text using the `find_user_password` method.

However, the `find_user_password` method seems to return password in plain-text. This poses a security risk because passwords are typically hashed and not stored in plain text for security reasons. If an attacker gains access to the `self.passwd` object, they could obtain the passwords of all users. 

Furthermore, since no validation or comparison is performed on the password, any string that matches the realm and host will be accepted as a valid password. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the `find_user_password` method should return hashed passwords instead of plain text. Then, the provided password should be hashed using the same hashing algorithm and salt, and compared to the hashed password returned by `find_user_password`.

Moreover, password comparison should be performed securely to avoid timing attacks. A good practice is to use a constant-time comparison function that compares the two hashed passwords character by character, rather than comparing the entire string at once.
