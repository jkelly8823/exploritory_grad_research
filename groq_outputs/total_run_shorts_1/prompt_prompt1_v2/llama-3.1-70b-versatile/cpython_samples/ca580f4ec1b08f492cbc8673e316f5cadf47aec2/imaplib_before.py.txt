VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure/eplained Constant.

EXPLANATION: 
Although a small snippet of code, there seems to be an obvious discrepancy on the naming convention. In general, Python uses snake_case for variable and constant names. As seen in the given code, 'IMAP4_SSL_PORT' adheres to this convention, but 'AllowedVersions' should ideally start with a lowercase 'a'. In addition, IMAP4_SSL_PORT might not be configured securely, eg using the non-encrypted variant of this protocol for communication.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
We should adhere to the established Python naming conventions for the 'AllowedVersions' constant by beginning it with a lowercase 'a'. In addition, instead of hardcoding SSL.port number, SSL_PORT could be looked up in an environment variable as an optional safety.

ORIGINAL CODE:
IMAP4_SSL_PORT = 993
AllowedVersions = ('IMAP4REV1', 'IMAP4')        # Most recent first

#       Commands

Commands = {
        # name            valid states

    def readline(self):
        """Read line from remote."""
        return self.file.readline()


    def send(self, data):
        """Send data to remote."""
