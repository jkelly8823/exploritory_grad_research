VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The included header files pose a potential vulnerability as they are outdated and do not provide the same level of security features as their newer counterparts.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes `<memory.h>` and `<string.h>`, which are both older header files that were part of the C programming standard. These headers were subsequently updated in the C++ standard, and it is generally recommended to use the updated headers `<cstring>` and potentially `<new>` for certain memory management functions.

The issue stems from the fact that the older headers might not provide the same level of security features or error checking as their newer counterparts. For example, the `strcpy` function in `<string.h>` is known to be susceptible to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if not used correctly, while the `strcpy` function in `<cstring>` provides additional error checking.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to update the included headers to `<cstring>` and potentially `<new>` instead of `<memory.h>` and `<string.h>`. Additionally, it is recommended to use more secure functions such as `strcpy_s` or `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`, and to ensure that proper error checking is performed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#include <memory.h>
#include <string.h>
