VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet demonstrates a potential Hardcoded Credentials vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION:
The provided code includes email addresses and corresponding names, potentially representing users and their credentials. These credentials are hardcoded directly into the code, which can pose a significant security risk if an attacker gains access to this code. They could then potentially use this information to compromise the system.

However, this might not be the case as these credentials may not represent actual login credentials but rather dummy or test user credentials. But since this context is missing and they do appear to be potential login credentials, treating them as potentially sensitive is warranted.

It appears to try to simulate SMTP server testing and connects to a mock email server, but there is a chance these could be real users' login credentials. Because this could potentially pose a risk for security, recommending safer alternatives is cautioned.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Do not hardcode sensitive data into your code, instead store credentials securely using environment variables or an external secrets management tool. It is assumed that this 'sim_users' dictionary might be part of a mocking test suite for an SMTP server. If actual usernames are required to perform the mock, use an external data source that securely manages test user data. If credentials are never going to be valid, do not include anything in the credential container as some developers might use malicious automated tools to examine repositories.
