VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Untrusted Input and Resource Depletion 
EXPLANATION:
This class appears to be representing a file-like object that provides read-only access to a list of lines. The `readline` method has two potential issues. Firstly, `self.lines.pop(0)` does not check if the list is empty, which could result in an IndexError, allowing an attacker to crash the program or potentially cause undefined behavior. Secondly, an attacker could potentially call `readline` many times, slowly depleting the list of lines and eventually causing an IndexError. This could be used in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always check if the list is not empty before popping elements. 
- Add error handling for situations where the list becomes empty.
- Implement a mechanism to limit the number of `readline` calls to prevent resource depletion attacks.
