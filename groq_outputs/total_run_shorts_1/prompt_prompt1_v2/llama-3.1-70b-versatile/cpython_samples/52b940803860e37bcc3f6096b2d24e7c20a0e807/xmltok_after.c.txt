VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability detected in the given code is a buffer overflow vulnerability. 

The buffer overflow vulnerability is introduced by the use of `memcpy` and `strcpy` without checking the bounds of the destination buffer. 

For example, in line 1142 and 1144 of the given code, the memcpy function is used without checking the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.

Furthermore, in lines 1147 and 1150, the strcpy function is used without checking the size of the destination buffer, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, in line 1202, the strcpy function is used without checking the size of the destination buffer.

In all these instances, the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause undefined behavior or execute malicious code by overwriting memory with arbitrary data.

EXPLANATION:
This buffer overflow vulnerability can occur when the memcpy or strcpy function is called with too much data, which exceeds the capacity of the buffer passed as the destination argument, leading to a buffer overflow and ensuing undefined behavior. When used with vulnerable code like this, these functions can cause the target's program counter to break and allow for code injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The memcpy and strcpy functions can be used safely if proper checks and bounds are applied:
- Check the return value of strcpy for errors.
- Ensure the source buffer's length does not exceed the destination buffer's capacity, avoiding buffer overflow and potential security risks.

For example:
```
n = strncpy(dst, src, dst_size);
if (n >= dst_size) {
  error = "String truncation occurred.";
}
```

A suitable secure coding practice is to favor the use of `strcpy_s` or `strncpy` over `strcpy`. Additionally, using safer function like `memcpy` can reduce the risks but you would still have to remember to manually fill in the extra byte needed to prevent information disclosure.

Instead of `strcpy_s` or `strcpy` we can re-write to include a fixed-size buffer and hence manually copying the array `dst` and `src`.
