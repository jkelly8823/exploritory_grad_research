VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Information Exposure Through Timing Attack
EXPLANATION:
The sip24_valid function performs a timing attack against the siphash24 function. This is done by returning early if the hash value generated by siphash24 for a given input is not equal to the expected hash value in the vectors array. This early return will have a slightly different timing when the hash value matches the expected value. An attacker who has control over the input data and can repeatedly measure the execution time of sip24_valid will be able to determine whether a specific message produced a specific hash value.

This type of vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker can measure the execution time of sip24_valid with a high degree of precision.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the sip24_valid function or refactor it to not use timing-dependent comparisons.
- Use a constant-time comparison function to compare the hash value with the expected value.
- If the functionality of the sip24_valid function is necessary, ensure that the execution time is constant regardless of whether the input matches the expected value.

ORIGINAL CODE:
(snip) The rest of the code is complex, for an optimal result, please address the sip24_valid function
```cpp
    if (siphash24(in, i, &k) != SIP_U8TO64_LE(vectors[i]))
      return 0;
```
