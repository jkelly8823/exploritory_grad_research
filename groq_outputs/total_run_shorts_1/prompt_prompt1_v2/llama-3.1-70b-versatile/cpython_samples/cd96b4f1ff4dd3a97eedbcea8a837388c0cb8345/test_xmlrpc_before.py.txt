VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Hardcoded Address and Port in XMLRPC Server Connection

EXPLANATION:
The code uses hardcoded values (`ADDR` and `PORT`) to connect to an XMLRPC server. This could be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks if an attacker is able to intercept and modify the traffic to the server. Hardcoding values also reduces the code's flexibility and makes it harder to test.

However, the main concern is that `ADDR` and `PORT` are not defined in this snippet. If they are not properly sanitized and validated elsewhere in the codebase, it could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Instead of hardcoding values, consider passing `ADDR` and `PORT` as arguments to the method or class.
2. Validate and sanitize `ADDR` and `PORT` to prevent SSRF attacks.
3. Use secure protocols (HTTPS instead of HTTP) for communication with the XMLRPC server.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def tearDown(self):
    # wait on the server thread to terminate
    self.evt.wait(4.0)
    # XXX this code does not work, and in fact stop_serving doesn't exist.
    if not self.evt.is_set():
        self.evt.set()
        stop_serving()
        raise RuntimeError("timeout reached, test has failed")

    # disable traceback reporting
    xmlrpc.server.SimpleXMLRPCServer._send_traceback_header = False

    server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://%s:%d/RPC2" % (ADDR, PORT))
    self.assertEqual(server.add("a", "\xe9"), "a\xe9")

    threadFunc = staticmethod(http_multi_server)
    request_count = 2
