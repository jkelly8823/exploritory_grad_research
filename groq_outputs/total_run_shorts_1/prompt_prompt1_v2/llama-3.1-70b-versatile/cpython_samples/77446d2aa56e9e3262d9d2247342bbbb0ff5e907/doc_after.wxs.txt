VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded path vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hardcoded path to an executable file (`C:\Windows\hh.exe`). Hardcoding file paths can lead to security vulnerabilities, as it can allow an attacker to predict and potentially exploit the location of this file. This can be particularly problematic if the executable is not properly validated or sanitized before being executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a dynamic method to determine the path to the executable, rather than hardcoding it. This could involve using an environment variable or a registry key that contains the path to the executable. Additionally, ensure that proper validation and sanitization are performed on the path before executing the file.
