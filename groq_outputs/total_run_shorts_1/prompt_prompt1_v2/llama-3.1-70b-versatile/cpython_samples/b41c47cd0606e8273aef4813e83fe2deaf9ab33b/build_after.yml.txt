VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a YAML file for a GitHub Actions workflow. It defines the environment variables, steps, and matrix for the workflow. The code snippet provided is incomplete, but based on the content, no obvious vulnerabilities were detected.

The use of environment variables and input parameters is properly handled. The code does not seem to be using any user input or untrusted data without proper sanitization. There are no obvious instances of command injection, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

However, it's essential to note that this analysis is limited to the provided code snippet and does not take into account the larger context of the workflow or the project.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
