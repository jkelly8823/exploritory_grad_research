VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a list extension with dictionary items containing sensitive data, but it does not seem to be vulnerable to any attacks. No user-controlled input, insecure function calls, or obvious security issues are apparent. The content is likely a data definition and not an executable or dynamically-generated code, thus reducing the risk of any direct vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Continue to monitor code quality and security best practices elsewhere in the project, especially when dealing with sensitive data like cryptographic checksums.
