VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential vulnerability was not found in the provided code snippet. However, there are Hardcoded values in the code snippet that could pose a potential security risk.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains versions of software specifically declared as variables. In this instance, the main one is the 'openssl_version'. As the code stands, anytime a new version of the software is released with a security patch, this code would have to be updated manually to reflect that. However, when it comes to this instance, it would appear as though there are no direct security threats that have been found within this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Hardcoding the version number of software could pose potential security risks because in the event of a backdoor or exploit being founded in future updates to the software, this code snippet will not automatically update. When writing this code, using an environment variable for this instead, could have been beneficial to allow for easier updates in the future to reflect the latest software patch. However, this is not identified as the problem here as no direct threat has been found.
