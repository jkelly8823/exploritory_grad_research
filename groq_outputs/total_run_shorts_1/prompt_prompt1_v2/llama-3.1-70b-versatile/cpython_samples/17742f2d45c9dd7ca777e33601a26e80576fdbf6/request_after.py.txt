VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Environment Variable Use.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is susceptible to an environment variable injection vulnerability. This occurs because the code directly uses environment variables (e.g., `os.environ`) to set proxy values without proper validation or sanitization.

Specifically, in lines 7-9, the code iterates over environment variables and checks if their names end with '_proxy'. If the name is in lowercase and has a value, the proxy value is used. However, this is still vulnerable to manipulation, especially if the environment variables are not validated before they are used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, implement input validation on the environment variables. Here are some recommendations:

1. Use a whitelist of allowed proxy environment variables.
2. Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions during environment variable access.
3. Validate environment variable names before using them.
4. Prefer using specific proxy variables, such as `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`, instead of iterating over all environment variables.

The following is an example of how this could be implemented:

```python
allowed_proxy_envs = ['http_proxy', 'https_proxy', 'ftp_proxy']
for name, value in os.environ.items():
    if name in allowed_proxy_envs:
        if value and name[-6:] == '_proxy':
            proxies[name[:-6]] = value
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
name = name.lower()
if value and name[-6:] == '_proxy':
    proxies[name[:-6]] = value
# CVE-2016-1000110 - If we are running as CGI script, forget HTTP_PROXY
# (non-all-lowercase) as it may be set from the web server by a "Proxy:"
# header from the client
# If "proxy" is lowercase, it will still be used thanks to the next block
if 'REQUEST_METHOD' in os.environ:
    proxies.pop('http', None)
for name, value in os.environ.items():
    if name[-6:] == '_proxy':
        name = name.lower()
        if value:
```
