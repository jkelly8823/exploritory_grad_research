VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Ignore of 'NO_PROXY' Environment Variable.
EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, we notice that 'bypass' function is utilizing the 'NO_PROXY' environment variable for making decisions about whether to use a proxy or not. However, it does not validate the contents of the environment variable, which is set to 'localhost, anotherdomain.com, newdomain.com:1234'. The issue lies in the fact that the function ignores the 'NO_PROXY' variable when the port is present, even though the port is correctly specified. This can potentially cause unexpected behavior as it ignores all IP addresses under 'newdomain.com' whereever port is given even for correct ones.

Moreover, The security concern lies in that local systems can alter this variable and therefore proxy might not be applied as expected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
In order to fix this vulnerability, we recommend that the code validates the contents of the 'NO_PROXY' environment variable and has strict rules for ignoring proxys for URLs on it. A method can be implemented to parse 'NO_PROXY' environment variable and validate whether given URL is under proxy. Usage of such a method would strengthen security.

ORGIGINAL CODE:

```python
self.assertTrue(urllib.request.proxy_bypass_environment('anotherdomain.com:8888'))
self.assertTrue(urllib.request.proxy_bypass_environment('newdomain.com:1234'))

def test_proxy_bypass_environment_host_match(self):
    bypass = urllib.request.proxy_bypass_environment
    self.env.set('NO_PROXY', 'localhost, anotherdomain.com, newdomain.com:1234')
```
