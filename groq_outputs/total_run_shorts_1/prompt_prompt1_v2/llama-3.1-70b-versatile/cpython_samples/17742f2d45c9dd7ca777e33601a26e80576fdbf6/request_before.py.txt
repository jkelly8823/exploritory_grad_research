VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
OS Command Injection Vulnerability due to Environmental Variable Handling

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet uses environmental variables to set proxy values. However, this code does not validate or sanitize the environmental variables before using them. This could potentially lead to an OS command injection vulnerability if an attacker can control the value of these variables, particularly if the values are used to construct system commands later in the code.

While this snippet itself does not show the actual command injection, it allows an attacker to set arbitrary proxy URLs, which could be exploited if used in HTTP requests or executed as shell commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, you should ensure that environmental variables are validated and sanitized before using them to set proxy values. Here are some recommendations:
- Whitelist the proxy URLs to prevent unauthorized applications from accessing sensitive data.
- Validate the format of proxy URLs to prevent arbitrary strings from being set as proxy URLs.
- Use URL parsing and validation libraries to ensure that the proxy URLs are valid and safe.
- Consider using secure parameters or environment variables instead of directly using user-input data.

ORIGINAL CODE:

        name = name.lower()
        if value and name[-6:] == '_proxy':
            proxies[name[:-6]] = value
    for name, value in os.environ.items():
        if name[-6:] == '_proxy':
            name = name.lower()
            if value:
