VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `[^.]+` is vulnerable to ReDoS. This vulnerability can cause the application to consume excessive CPU resources and even lead to a denial of service. The problem with this regular expression is that it is trying to match against any single character that is not a dot, but it does not specify a maximum repetition. When a string with a large number of adjacent characters other than a dot is passed to this function, the regular expression engine may enter a catastrophic backtracking scenario, drastically slowing down or even causing the application to hang.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be modified to avoid backtracking. This can be achieved by making the repetition possessive or by using atomic groups. Here is an example of a fixed version of the regular expression:
```python
([^.]+(?:=.))
```
However, an even better solution would be to use a more efficient and less prone to backtracking pattern such as the following:
```python
([^.])
``` 
In order to fit the current design of this code, we would need to also ensure we have a way of getting the full content from our "[^.]+" regex pattern created here. Another possible approach could be the usage of `(?<!\.)[\S]+` However this all highly depends on the scope, definition and requirements of this method.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
def _dnsname_to_pat(dn):
    pats = []
    for frag in dn.split(r'.'):
        if frag == '*':
            # When '*' is a fragment by itself, it matches a non-empty dotless
            # fragment.
            pats.append('[^.]+')
```
