VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a test suite, specifically testing the ssl.match_hostname function and the handling of wildcard certificates. The code checks for expected exceptions, tests certificate matching, and verifies that denial of service attacks are prevented by refusing more than one wildcard per fragment. No obvious vulnerabilities or issues were found in the given code.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
self.assertRaises(ValueError, ssl.match_hostname, None, 'example.com')
self.assertRaises(ValueError, ssl.match_hostname, {}, 'example.com')

# Issue #17980: avoid denials of service by refusing more than one
# wildcard per fragment.
cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'a*b.com'),),)}
ok(cert, 'axxb.com')
cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'a*b.co*'),),)}
ok(cert, 'axxb.com')
cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'a*b*.com'),),)}
with self.assertRaises(ssl.CertificateError) as cm:
    ssl.match_hostname(cert, 'axxbxxc.com')
self.assertIn("too many wildcards", str(cm.exception))
