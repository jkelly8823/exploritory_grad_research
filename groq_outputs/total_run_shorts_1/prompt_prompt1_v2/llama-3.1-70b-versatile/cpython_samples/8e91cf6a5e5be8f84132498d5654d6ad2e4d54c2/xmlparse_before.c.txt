VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Null pointer dereferences, and use of a null pointer in memory operations.

EXPLANATION:
The `lookup` function is used to search for an object in a hash table. However, it can return null if the object is not found or if there is an error. The code does not always check for null before trying to use the returned pointer.

In the `dtdCopy` function, the code uses the `lookup` function to find an element type and an attribute ID without checking if the returned pointer is null. If the `lookup` function returns null, the code will try to access the members of the null pointer, which can cause a segmentation fault.

In the `copyEntityTable` function, the code uses the `lookup` function to find an entity without checking if the returned pointer is null. If the `lookup` function returns null, the code will try to access the members of the null pointer, which can cause a segmentation fault.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these issues, the code should always check if the returned pointer from the `lookup` function is null before trying to use it. The code should handle the case where the returned pointer is null and use default values or return an error if the lookup operation fails.

Here are some specific code changes that can fix these issues:

In the `dtdCopy` function, the code should check if the `lookup` function returns null before trying to access its members:
```c
newE = (ELEMENT_TYPE *)lookup(&(newDtd->elementTypes), name, sizeof(ELEMENT_TYPE));
if (!newE)
    return 0;

...

newA = (ATTRIBUTE_ID *)lookup(&(newDtd->attributeIds), name, sizeof(ATTRIBUTE_ID));
if (!newA)
    return 0;
```

In the `copyEntityTable` function, the code should check if the `lookup` function returns null before trying to access its members:
```c
newE = (ENTITY *)lookup(newTable, name, sizeof(ENTITY));
if (!newE)
    return 0;
```

In the `lookup` function, the code should check if the `name` parameter is null before trying to use it:
```c
if (!name)
    return NULL;
```
