VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Untrusted input may be used to access arbitrary attributes of the object.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the use of the `urltype` variable, which is used to construct the `name` attribute that is later used to check for an attribute on the object using `hasattr(self, name)`. This is a potential vulnerability if `urltype` comes from an untrusted source, such as user input.

In this case, an attacker could manipulate the `urltype` to access arbitrary attributes of the object, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's recommended to:

- Verify that `urltype` comes from a trusted source.
- Validate the value of `urltype` to ensure it only contains allowed values.
- Use a dictionary or mapping to access attributes instead of using `hasattr` and dynamic attribute names.

Alternatively, consider refactoring the code to not use dynamic attribute access:

```python
allowed_types = {'http', 'https', 'ftp'}
name = 'open_' + urltype
if urltype in allowed_types and hasattr(self, name):
    # proceed with access
else:
    # handle unknown or invalid type
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
name = 'open_' + urltype
self.type = urltype
name = name.replace('-', '_')
if not hasattr(self, name):
    if proxy:
        return self.open_unknown_proxy(proxy, fullurl, data)
    else:
        return self.open_unknown(fullurl, data)
```
