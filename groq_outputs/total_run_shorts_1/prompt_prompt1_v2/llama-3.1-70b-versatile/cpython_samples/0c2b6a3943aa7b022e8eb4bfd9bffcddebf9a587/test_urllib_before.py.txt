VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure use of URLopener to retrieve files from an url.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `urllib.request.URLopener()` to retrieve a file from a URL and save it to a local file. However, this is insecure because `URLopener` does not do any verification of the file being downloaded and does not follow security best practices for downloading files. Specifically, it does not verify the security of the connection (it does not check for HTTPS) and it does not validate the type or contents of the file before saving it locally.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using `URLopener`, consider using `urllib.request.urlretrieve` or the `requests` library, which provide more flexibility and security features. Also, ensure that the URL is secure (HTTPS) and that the type and contents of the file are validated before saving it locally.
```python
import requests

response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code == 200:
    filename = response.url.split("/")[-1]
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    self.assertEqual(os.path.splitext(filename)[1], ".txt")
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
filename, _ = urllib.request.URLopener().retrieve(url)
self.assertEqual(os.path.splitext(filename)[1], ".txt")

# Can't really tell why keep failing in windows and sparc.
# Everywhere else they work ok, but on those machines, sometimes
