VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 79, 92, 113, 125, 209
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is an integer overflow vulnerability that occurs when calculating the length of a memory buffer. This vulnerability could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the calculated length is used to allocate memory.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in several places in the code where the length of a memory buffer is calculated by multiplying the length of the input buffer by the size of the output data type (e.g. int16, int32). However, the code does not check if the resulting length would exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an integer (INT_MAX). If the length exceeds INT_MAX, the calculated length will wrap around and result in a smaller value, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

For example, in the lines 79, 92, and 113, the code checks if `len/size > INT_MAX/size2` or `len > INT_MAX/size` to prevent integer overflow. However, in lines 125 and 209, the code does not perform this check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the code should add checks to ensure that the calculated length of the memory buffer does not exceed INT_MAX. The checks should be similar to those already present in lines 79, 92, and 113.

Here is an example of the recommended change:
```c
if (len > INT_MAX/size) {
    PyErr_SetString(PyExc_MemoryError,
                    "not enough memory for output buffer");
    return 0;
}
```
