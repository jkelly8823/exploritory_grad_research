VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet contains a vulnerability related to SSL verification. Specifically, when `certreq` is equal to `PY_SSL_CERT_OPTIONAL`, the SSL verification mode is set to `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`. However, this verification mode is only active when a certificate is present, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code sets the SSL verification mode based on the value of `certreq`. When `certreq` is `PY_SSL_CERT_OPTIONAL`, the verification mode is set to `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`, which is intended to verify the identity of the server. However, if the server does not provide a certificate, the verification will still succeed, allowing for a potential MITM attack. This is because `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` does not require a certificate to be present, but rather verifies the certificate if it is present. To mitigate this vulnerability, the verification mode should be set to require a certificate, such as `SSL_VERIFY_PEER | SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the recommendation is to use `SSL_VERIFY_PEER | SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT` instead of just `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` when verifying the server identity. This will ensure that a certificate is always present and verified.
