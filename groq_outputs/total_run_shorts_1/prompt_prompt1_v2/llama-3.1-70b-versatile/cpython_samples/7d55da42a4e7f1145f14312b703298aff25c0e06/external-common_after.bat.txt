VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-13, 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability and uses outdated versions of software. 
EXPLANATION:
An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands by exploiting the 'svn export' statement, or modify the version numbers in statements including lines 1-5 and lines 6-13. It is uncertain whether these statements will be interpreted correctly due to its variable nature. 
The 'svn export http://svn.python.org/projects/external/openssl-1.0.1h' statement poses an issue if an attacker gained write privileges to svn.python.org then a different url could be linked.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a whitelist to validate input. Never incorporate unsanitized user input into commands that you execute.
- Refactor commands and their paths. 
- Review current library releases for each program in lines 1-13.
- Update code to utilize public variable paths and names if applicable using environment variables instead of hard-coded URLs.
- Update paths being removed such as rd /s/q. Secure by fully writing the removal operation with both folder and filename.
