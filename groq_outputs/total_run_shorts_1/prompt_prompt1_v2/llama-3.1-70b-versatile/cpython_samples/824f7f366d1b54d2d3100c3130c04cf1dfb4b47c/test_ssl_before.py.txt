VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Certificate Validation Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be testing certificate verification. However, it calls the `fail` function when the certificates are validated against 'foo.a.com' and 'bar.foo.com', but it does not check if the certificates are valid for the expected domains. This may indicate that the certificate verification is not properly implemented, and the function `fail` may be used to catch verification failures, rather than to handle successful validation. Additionally, it uses a certificate with 'notAfter' date that has long expired (Jun 26 21:41:46 2011 GMT), which makes it vulnerable to security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
We recommend to properly implement certificate verification by checking the certificate's validity period and its subjectAltName fields to match the expected domains. The `fail` function should be used to catch and handle unexpected errors, but should not be a part of the validation logic. The code should properly handle the expiration dates of certificates and reject expired certificates.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
WRONGCERT = data_file("XXXnonexisting.pem")
BADKEY = data_file("badkey.pem")
NOKIACERT = data_file("nokia.pem")

DHFILE = data_file("dh512.pem")
BYTES_DHFILE = os.fsencode(DHFILE)

                          ('DNS', 'projects.forum.nokia.com'))
                        )

    def test_DER_to_PEM(self):
        with open(SVN_PYTHON_ORG_ROOT_CERT, 'r') as f:
            pem = f.read()
        d1 = ssl.PEM_cert_to_DER_cert(pem)
        fail(cert, 'foo.a.com')
        fail(cert, 'bar.foo.com')

        # Slightly fake real-world example
        cert = {'notAfter': 'Jun 26 21:41:46 2011 GMT',
                'subject': ((('commonName', 'linuxfrz.org'),),),
                'subjectAltName': (('DNS', 'linuxfr.org'),
