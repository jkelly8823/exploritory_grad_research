VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code may be vulnerable to integer overflow when calculating `*low`.

EXPLANATION:
The calculation `p - reg->dmax` may result in an integer overflow if `p` and `reg->dmax` are large and have opposite signs. This is because the subtraction operation can exceed the maximum limit of the integer data type, causing the result to wrap around and become a very small number. As a result, `*low` may be set to an incorrect value, potentially leading to incorrect results or undefined behavior.

Additionally, the check `*low > s` is also vulnerable to integer underflow if `s` is a very small number. This can again result in incorrect results or undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, consider using a safe integer arithmetic library or implementing checks to prevent integer overflows and underflows. Specifically:

- Check if `p` and `reg->dmax` are large and have opposite signs before performing the subtraction.
- Check if `s` is a very small number before performing the comparison.
- Use a safe integer arithmetic library to handle the calculation and comparison.

It's also worth noting that the use of signed integers for `p`, `reg->dmax`, and `s` may be a design flaw if these variables are intended to represent distances or lengths. Using unsigned integers instead may help to prevent these vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    else {
      if (reg->dmax != ONIG_INFINITE_DISTANCE) {
	*low = p - reg->dmax;
	if (*low > s) {
	  *low = onigenc_get_right_adjust_char_head_with_prev(reg->enc, s,
							      *low, (const UChar** )low_prev);
	  if (low_prev && IS_NULL(*low_prev))
	    *low_prev = onigenc_get_prev_char_head(reg->enc,
					       (pprev ? pprev : str), *low);
	}
      }
    }
    /* no needs to adjust *high, *high is used as range check only */
    *high = p - reg->dmin;
