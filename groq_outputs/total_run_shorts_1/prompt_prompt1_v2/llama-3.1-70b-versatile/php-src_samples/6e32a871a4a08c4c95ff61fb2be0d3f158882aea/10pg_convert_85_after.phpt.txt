VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the line `pg_query($db, "SET standard_conforming_strings = 0");`. By disabling standard_conforming_strings, this code snippet allows untrusted input to be treated as a potential SQL injection vector. Specifically, by setting standard_conforming_strings to 0, the application becomes more susceptible to backslash character escaping vulnerabilities. This setting controls the use of backslash as an escape character, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by adding backslashes to user input. While this does not inherently open up a vulnerability in this specific snippet, as it relies on user input elsewhere in the application, in prior versions of this application, standard_conforming_strings set to off enables an attacker to end strings with a backslash thus making it possible for the attacker to execute malicious SQL. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of disabling standard_conforming_strings, ensure input is properly sanitized and parameterized. Preventing the use of backslashes as escape characters mitigates backslash character escaping vulnerabilities. However, relying on this feature alone is not enough to ensure the security of the application. Implement well-structured input validation and proper data type casting to ensure no malicious data enters the database.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
include 'config.inc';

$db = pg_connect($conn_str);
pg_query($db, "SET standard_conforming_strings = 0");

$fields = array('num'=>'1234', 'str'=>'AAA', 'bin'=>'BBB');
$converted = pg_convert($db, $table_name, $fields);
```
