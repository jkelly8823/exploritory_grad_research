VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Vulnerability due to potential SQL injection and SQL execution error.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable due to the use of user-defined variable $table_name without any validation or sanitization. If the $table_name comes from an untrusted source, an attacker could inject malicious SQL, potentially leading to arbitrary SQL execution. Additionally, the use of pg_query() with a user-defined query string after setting standard_conforming_strings to 0 can also lead to SQL injection if an attacker has control over the query string. Furthermore, the pg_insert function has been deprecated since PHP 7.4.0 and it will be removed in PHP 8.0.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Instead of using pg_insert, consider using prepared statements with pg_prepare() and pg_execute(). 
2. Validate and sanitize the $table_name to prevent SQL injection.
3. Remove the use of pg_query() with a string query. Instead use a parameterized query if required.
4. Consider upgrading the PHP version to at least 7.4.0 and use the PDO or pgsql extension to prevent deprecation warnings.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
include 'config.inc';

$db = pg_connect($conn_str);
pg_query($db, "SET standard_conforming_strings = 0");

$fields = array('num'=>'1234', 'str'=>'AAA', 'bin'=>'BBB');

pg_insert($db, $table_name, $fields) or print "Error in test 1\n";
echo pg_insert($db, $table_name, $fields, PGSQL_DML_STRING)."\n";
```
