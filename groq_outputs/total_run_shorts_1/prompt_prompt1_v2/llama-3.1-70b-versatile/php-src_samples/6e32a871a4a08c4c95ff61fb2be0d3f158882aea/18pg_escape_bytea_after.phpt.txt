VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The variables `$table_name` and `$conn_str` are not defined within the provided code snippet, suggesting that they may be user-controlled or defined elsewhere. However, assuming these variables can be controlled by the user, the code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The `$table_name` variable is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Additionally, the `$conn_str` variable, which is presumably used to establish a connection to the database, may also be vulnerable to injection attacks if it is not properly sanitized.

The use of `pg_escape_bytea` on the `$image` variable is not a vulnerability in itself, but it is worth noting that it does not protect against SQL injection attacks. It only protects against corrupting the binary data stored in the database.

The line `pg_query($db, 'SELECT * FROM '.$table_name.' WHERE num = 9876');` also uses the `$table_name` variable unsafely.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Unfortunately, since the provided code is using the older `pg_query` function, we need to use the newer PDO library or `pg_prepare` and `pg_execute` functions for more secure query execution.

Here's an example using the `pg_prepare` and `pg_execute` functions:

```php
$table_name = 'your_table_name';
$num = 9876;
$image = file_get_contents(dirname(__FILE__) . '/php.gif');
$esc_image = pg_escape_bytea($image);

$result = pg_prepare($db, 'insert_image', "INSERT INTO $table_name (num, bin) VALUES ($1, $2)");
$result = pg_execute($db, 'insert_image', array($num, $esc_image));

$result = pg_prepare($db, 'select_image', "SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE num = $1");
$result = pg_execute($db, 'select_image', array($num));
$rows = pg_fetch_all($result);
$unesc_image = pg_unescape_bytea($rows[0]['bin']);
```

Note that even with parameterized queries, using user-controlled input for table or column names is not recommended and can still lead to security vulnerabilities. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
include('config.inc');

$db = pg_connect($conn_str);

$image = file_get_contents(dirname(__FILE__) . '/php.gif');
$esc_image = pg_escape_bytea($image);

pg_query($db, 'INSERT INTO '.$table_name.' (num, bin) VALUES (9876, \''.$esc_image.'\');');
$result = pg_query($db, 'SELECT * FROM '.$table_name.' WHERE num = 9876');
$rows = pg_fetch_all($result);
$unesc_image = pg_unescape_bytea($rows[0]['bin']);
```
