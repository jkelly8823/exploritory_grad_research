VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present in the provided code snippet is a potential SQL Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `pg_insert` function is used to insert data into a PostgreSQL database. In this code snippet, the `pg_insert` function is called with data from the `$fields` array, which is not properly sanitized. This could lead to a SQL Injection attack if an attacker is able to manipulate the contents of the `$fields` array.

Furthermore, the `PGSQL_DML_STRING` parameter in the second `pg_insert` call is not used correctly. This parameter is used to specify the type of the data being inserted, and using it with arbitrary data can lead to SQL errors or even SQL Injection attacks.

Additionally, the `$table_name` variable is not checked for any malicious characters, which could lead to a SQL Injection attack as well.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend the following changes:

* Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This will prevent SQL Injection attacks by separating the code from the data.
* Validate and sanitize any user-provided input before passing it to the `pg_insert` function.
* Use the `PGSQL_DML_STRING` parameter correctly and only with trusted data.

It is recommended to use a more secure and modern way of interacting with the database, such as using the `PDO` extension with PostgreSQL.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
include 'config.inc';

$db = pg_connect($conn_str);
$fields = array('num'=>'1234', 'str'=>'AAA', 'bin'=>'BBB');

pg_insert($db, $table_name, $fields) or print "Error in test 1\n";
echo pg_insert($db, $table_name, $fields, PGSQL_DML_STRING)."\n";
```
