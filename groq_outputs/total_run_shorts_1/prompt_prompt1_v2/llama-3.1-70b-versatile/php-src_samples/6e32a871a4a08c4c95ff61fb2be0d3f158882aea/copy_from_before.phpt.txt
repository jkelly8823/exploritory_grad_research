VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Exception Handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet echoes the line number and message of an exception. While this might seem harmless, it could potentially leak sensitive information about the system or the internals of the application, especially if the error message includes any system paths, database credentials, or other sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid echoing the line number where the exception occurred. This information is only necessary for debugging purposes and should not be exposed to the end-user.
2. Use logging mechanisms instead of echoing the error message. This will allow the developer to securely log the error for debugging purposes without exposing the information to the end-user.
3. Remove the line number from the error message.

Additionally, a try-catch block is being used but the exception handling is not complete, as there is no finally block to handle the exception even if it is caught.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
echo "Exception! at line ", $e->getLine(), "\n";
var_dump($e->getMessage());
}
if(isset($filename)) {
    @unlink($filename);
}
?>
