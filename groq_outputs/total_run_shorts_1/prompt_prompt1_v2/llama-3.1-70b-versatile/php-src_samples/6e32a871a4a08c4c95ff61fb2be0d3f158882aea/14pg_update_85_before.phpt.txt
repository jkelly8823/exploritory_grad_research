VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct usage of user-controlled data in the `$table_name` variable without proper sanitization. Since `$table_name` is not visible in the provided code snippet, we assume that its value is determined elsewhere. If it comes from an untrusted source, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code.

The `pg_update` function is also at risk because it uses variable values directly in the SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection. The `$fields` and `$ids` arrays may contain user-controlled data, which could lead to further SQL injection risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should:

1. Sanitize the `$table_name` variable: Make sure that it comes from a trusted source or validate and escape it properly.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements: Modify the `pg_update` function to use parameterized queries, where values are separated from SQL code. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code.
3. Validate and sanitize user-controlled input: Ensure that the values in the `$fields` and `$ids` arrays come from trusted sources or validate and escape them properly.

Here is a rough example of how to use a parameterized query:
```php
$stmt = pg_prepare($db, 'update', "UPDATE " . pg_escape_identifier($table_name) . " SET num = $1, str = $2 WHERE num = $3");
pg_execute($stmt, array($fields['num'], $fields['str'], $ids['num']));
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
include 'config.inc';

$db = pg_connect($conn_str);
$fields = array('num'=>'1234', 'str'=>'ABC', 'bin'=>'XYZ');
$ids = array('num'=>'1234');

pg_update($db, $table_name, $fields, $ids) or print "Error in test 1\n";
```
