VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
Upon analyzing the provided code snippet, I have not found any signs of potential security vulnerabilities. The code calculates the difference between two dates using the `date_diff` function and then outputs the resulting `DateInterval` object using `var_dump`. There are no user-controlled inputs, data being stored or retrieved, or operations that could potentially lead to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$diff = date_diff($date, $other);

var_dump($diff);
--EXPECTF--
object(DateInterval)#%d (15) {
