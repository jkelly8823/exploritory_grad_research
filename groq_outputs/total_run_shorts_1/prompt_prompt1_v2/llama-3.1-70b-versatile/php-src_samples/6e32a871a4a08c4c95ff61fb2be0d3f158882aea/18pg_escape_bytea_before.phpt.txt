VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a SQL injection vulnerability because the table name is directly included in the query string without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the table name. 

For example, if an attacker could manipulate the table name to be 'users WHERE 1 OR 1=1', they would be able to inject malicious SQL code and potentially access unauthorized data. This type of vulnerability is especially severe given the stakes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the table name should be properly sanitized before it is included in the query string. One way to sanitize it is to use prepared statements with a whitelist of allowed table names. This will prevent the injection of arbitrary SQL code. Alternatively, you can use string escaping functions provided by the PostgreSQL connection library, but be cautious of its limitations and edge cases.

However, in this case, since we are dealing with PostgreSQL, a far better approach is to use parameterized queries, where you replace variables with $1, $2, etc., and then pass an array of values to the query. The values will be treated as literal input and can't be executed as SQL code.

Here's an example:

```php
 db = pg_connect($conn_str);
$stmt = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO $1 (num, bin) VALUES ($2, $3)');
$stmt->execute(array($table_name, 9876, $esc_image));

$stmt = $db->prepare('SELECT * FROM $1 WHERE num = $2');
$stmt->execute(array($table_name, 9876));
$result = $stmt->fetchAll();

```


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
include('config.inc');

$image = file_get_contents(dirname(__FILE__) . '/php.gif');
$esc_image = pg_escape_bytea($image);

$db = pg_connect($conn_str);
pg_query($db, 'INSERT INTO '.$table_name.' (num, bin) VALUES (9876, \''.$esc_image.'\');');
$result = pg_query($db, 'SELECT * FROM '.$table_name.' WHERE num = 9876');
$rows = pg_fetch_all($result);
$unesc_image = pg_unescape_bytea($rows[0]['bin']);
```
