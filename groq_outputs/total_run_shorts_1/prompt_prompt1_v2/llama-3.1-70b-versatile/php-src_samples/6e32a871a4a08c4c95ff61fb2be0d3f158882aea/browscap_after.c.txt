VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 35-36
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to an unfreed allocation of memory in the `browscap_zval_copy_ctor` function and a directly allocated memory in the main function.

EXPLANATION:
In the `browscap_zval_copy_ctor` function, memory is allocated for the new `zval` using `ALLOC_ZVAL(new)`. This allocation is never explicitly freed, although it is reassigned to `*p`. However, this only transfers ownership of the memory and does not prevent a memory leak. Additionally, in the main function, memory is directly allocated for `lookup_browser_name` using `efree(lookup_browser_name)`, but there is no corresponding allocation shown in the code snippet. If this memory was allocated earlier, there could be potential leaks if it wasn't freed properly earlier, otherwise, this efree call will result in an undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent potential memory leaks, ensure that any allocated memory is properly freed. Specifically:
-  Add `efree(*new)` after `*p = new` in the `browscap_zval_copy_ctor` function to free the original memory.
- Ensure that any directly allocated memory, such as `lookup_browser_name`, is freed in all possible paths, not just at the end of the function.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```cpp

static void browscap_zval_copy_ctor(zval **p) /* {{{ */

	zval *new;

	ALLOC_ZVAL(new);
	*new = **p;

	zval_copy_ctor(new);

	INIT_PZVAL(new);
	*p = new;
} /* }}} */
