VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4, 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to integer overflow and potential information disclosure due to the misuse of assembly instructions.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippets appear to be performing multiplication and addition using inline assembly instructions. However, there are potential issues with these implementations.

In the first snippet (lines 3-4), the 'mull' instruction is used to multiply two 16-bit values, and then 'addl' and 'adcl' are used to add and adjust the carry. However, the 'mull' instruction only multiplies the AL register with the specified value, not the whole word. This may cause unexpected behavior if dealing with larger values.

In the second snippet (lines 9-10), the 'mulq' instruction is used to multiply 64-bit values. However, the inline assembly syntax does not ensure that the 'rbx' and 'rdx' registers are correctly saved and restored. This could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect results if the registers are not properly handled outside of this assembly block.

Both snippets lack proper error handling for overflows, which could result in unexpected behavior or data corruption when dealing with large values.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use compiler-optimized multiplication instead of inline assembly to avoid potential issues with carry flags and register state.
2. Use a library function that checks for overflows and handles them correctly (e.g., `__builtin_mul_overflow` for GCC or Clang).
3. Consider using a language's built-in integer promotion rules and overflow detection mechanisms.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
    size_t res = nmemb;
    unsigned long overflow = 0;

    __asm__ ("mull %3\n\taddl %4,%0\n\tadcl %1,%1"
         : "=&a"(res), "=&d" (overflow)
         : "%0"(res),
           "rm"(size),
           "rm"(offset));
    size_t res = nmemb;
    unsigned long overflow = 0;

    __asm__ ("mulq %3\n\taddq %4,%0\n\tadcq %1,%1"
         : "=&a"(res), "=&d" (overflow)
         : "%0"(res),
           "rm"(size),
           "rm"(offset));
