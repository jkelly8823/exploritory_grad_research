VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a simple PHP statement that formats a DateInterval object and prints the result. The echo statement is correctly used to output the result, and there is no insecure data handling or processing.

However, it is worth noting that the variable $i is not defined in this snippet, but it is assumed to be a DateInterval object, which is being used correctly.

Additionally, the --EXPECT-- section is likely a test expectation and does not affect the vulnerability of the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, no changes are recommended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
echo $i->format("%a"), "\n";
?>
--EXPECT--

  int(0)
  int(0)
  ["s"]=>
  int(0)
  ["invert"]=>
  int(0)
  ["days"]=>
  bool(false)
}
