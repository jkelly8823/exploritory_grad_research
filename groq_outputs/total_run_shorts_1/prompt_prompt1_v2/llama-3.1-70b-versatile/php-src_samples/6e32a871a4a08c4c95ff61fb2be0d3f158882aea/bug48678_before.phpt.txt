VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a debug output of a PHP array and a DateInterval object. No user input is being processed, and there is no evidence of insecure coding practices.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
[h] => 12
[i] => 30
[s] => 5
[invert] => 0
[days] =>%s
)
DateInterval Object
(
[y] => 3
[h] => 12
[i] => 30
[s] => 5
[invert] => 0
[days] =>%s
)```

Note: The code seems to be missing parts, but it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that a DateInterval object is used, but without the code of the class or how it is manipulated, no conclusion can be drawn.
