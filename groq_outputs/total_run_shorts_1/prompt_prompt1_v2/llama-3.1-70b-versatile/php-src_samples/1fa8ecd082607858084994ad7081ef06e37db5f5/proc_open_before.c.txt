VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be using a preprocessor directive (`#ifdef`) to conditionally compile code based on the presence of a symbol. While preprocessor directives can be used in conjunction with vulnerable code, this code snippet itself does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet checks if the symbol `PHP_CAN_SUPPORT_PROC_OPEN` is defined before potentially compiling the code that follows. This is a common technique in C and C-like languages to adapt code to different platforms or configurations. Without more context or subsequent code, it is impossible to assess whether the code within this conditional compilation directive contains any vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since this code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities, no recommendations are provided.

ORIGINAL CODE:

/* This symbol is defined in ext/standard/config.m4.
 * Essentially, it is set if you HAVE_FORK || PHP_WIN32
 * Other platforms may modify that configure check and add suitable #ifdefs
 * around the alternate code.
 * */
#ifdef PHP_CAN_SUPPORT_PROC_OPEN
