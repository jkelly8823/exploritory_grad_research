VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No specific vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a conditional compilation directive, specifically checking for the existence of a symbol (PHP_CAN_SUPPORT_PROC_OPEN) defined in a configuration file. This directive is used to control the compilation of platform-specific code. The code snippet itself does not contain any potentially vulnerable code.

The context provided suggests that the symbol is used to determine whether the platform supports process creation. However, without additional context or code, it's not possible to identify any vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
/* This symbol is defined in ext/standard/config.m4.
 * Essentially, it is set if you HAVE_FORK || PHP_WIN32
 * Other platforms may modify that configure check and add suitable #ifdefs
 * around the alternate code.
 * */
#ifdef PHP_CAN_SUPPORT_PROC_OPEN
