VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This PHP code snippet itself does not directly contain vulnerabilities but one statement leaves the code open to potential issues.

EXPLANATION:
The provided PHP code uses 'die' which can be problematic if an attacker was to target this application. The 'die' function will display its argument to the user when run in a web context, and if 'die' is fed an uninitialized variable or function which was set by a malicious user or code, this could inadvertently reveal internal details about the application or system to an attacker.

Additionally, though this check isn't related to this block of PHP it leaves it open for review at this time. The code checks to ensure an integer is of the value '2147483647,' which represents the INT_MAX value for systems that use 'long' integers. The INT_MAX on 32-bit systems, including some MySQL database default integer value, being used means this will impact certain databases. 

Because users cannot currently run this code in a 64-bit PHP context and also run in to problems with any and/or a MySQL back end storing using 32-bit integers, this integer size must remain being noted in case we will create cross-platform code, potentially causing unintended issues with integer overflow errors in math function calls or other issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
More secure code might use 'exit' function instead, but also ensure that before it happens - we output no detailed or debug info.

```php
<?php
if (PHP_INT_MAX !== 2147483647)
	exit();
?>
```

also the error or notice handling should be dealt with in some more safer manner:

```php
<?php
if (PHP_INT_MAX !== 2147483647){
	    error_log('int max mismatch');
	    exit(0);
}
?>
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
--TEST--
Bug #62097: fix for bug #54547 is wrong for 32-bit machines
--SKIPIF--
<php
if (PHP_INT_MAX !== 2147483647)
	die('skip for system with 32-bit wide longs only');
