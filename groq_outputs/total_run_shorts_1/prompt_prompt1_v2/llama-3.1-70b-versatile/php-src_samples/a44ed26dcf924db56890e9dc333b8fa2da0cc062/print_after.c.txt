VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18-21, 23-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is an off-by-one error in the input buffer for the asctime_r() and ctime_r() functions, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

EXPLANATION:
The strcspn() function is used to calculate the length of the string returned by asctime_r() or ctime_r(), and the last character of the string (which is a newline character) is overwritten with a null character. However, this does not guarantee that the string returned by asctime_r() or ctime_r() will be null-terminated within the buffer.

When the asctime_r() or ctime_r() function is called, it will write the formatted time string to the input buffer. However, the return value of these functions is a pointer to the beginning of the buffer, not the null-terminated string. This means that the caller of these functions is responsible for ensuring that the input buffer is large enough to hold the result.

If the input buffer is not large enough to hold the result, the asctime_r() or ctime_r() function will write past the end of the buffer, causing undefined behavior and potentially a buffer overflow. When this buffer overflow occurs, the strcspn() function will also be called with an invalid string pointer, potentially causing another off-by-one error or buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend the following changes:

1. Check the size of the input buffer before calling asctime_r() or ctime_r(). This can be done by passing the size of the buffer as the third argument to these functions.

```c
pp = asctime_r(tm, buf, sizeof(buf));
```
or
```c
pp = ctime_r(&t, buf, sizeof(buf));
```

However, this would likely break the standard behavior of these functions.

2. Alternatively, ensure that the input buffer is large enough to hold the largest possible string returned by asctime_r() or ctime_r(). The length of the longest possible string returned by asctime_r() or ctime_r() is not specified in the standards, but in most implementations, it is 26 or 30 characters.

```c
char buf[26]; // or char buf[30];
```

        // XXX: perhaps detect and print something if overflow
        // on 32 bit time_t?
        t = (time_t)v;
        }

        if (flags & FILE_T_LOCAL) {
        pp = ctime_r(&t, buf);
            goto out;
        pp = asctime_r(tm, buf);
        }
        if (tm == NULL)
        goto out;
        pp = asctime_r(tm, buf);

        if (pp == NULL)
        goto out;
        pp[strcspn(pp, "\n")] = '\0';
