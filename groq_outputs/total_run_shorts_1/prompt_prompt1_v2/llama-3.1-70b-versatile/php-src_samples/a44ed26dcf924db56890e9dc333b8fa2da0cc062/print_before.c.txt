VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses an insecure function `ctime_r` and `asctime_r` to format a timestamp string. These functions do not guarantee against buffer overflow and are vulnerable to attacks if the input buffer is not properly checked.

EXPLANATION:
The `ctime_r` and `asctime_r` functions are designed to work with a user-provided buffer `buf` to store the formatted timestamp. However, these functions do not perform any bounds checking or size validation on the provided buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerability if the buffer is too small to hold the formatted timestamp.

In this case, the code uses an immediate assignment from the return value of `ctime_r` and `asctime_r` to `pp` without checking the return value for errors. This makes the code vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace `ctime_r` and `asctime_r` with `strftime` function from the `time` library, which allows specifying the buffer size and provides better control over formatting and buffer safety.
2. Validate the buffer size before calling `ctime_r` and `asctime_r`, and handle any potential errors.

		pp = ctime_r(&t, buf);
			goto out;
		pp = asctime_r(tm, buf);
	}

	if (pp == NULL)
		goto out;
	pp[strcspn(pp, "\n")] = '\0';
