VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 92, 105
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability in cdf_file_catalog_info() function and cdf_file_summary_info() function.

EXPLANATION:
The code has a buffer overflow vulnerability in cdf_file_catalog_info() function and cdf_file_summary_info() function. In both functions, a file_printf() function is called to print formatted strings directly to a file descriptor without properly checking the length of the input string. This could potentially allow an attacker to overflow the buffer by providing a large input string, leading to arbitrary code execution.

In the cdf_file_catalog_info() function (line 92), the file_printf() function is called to print the formatted string without checking the length of the si->name and si->mime strings.

In the cdf_file_summary_info() function (line 105), the file_printf() function is called to print the formatted string without checking the length of the expn string.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the input strings and ensure that they do not exceed the maximum allowed length. You can use the following methods:

* Use snprintf() or formatted I/O functions that allow specifying the output buffer size to prevent buffer overflows.
* Add input validation to ensure that the input strings do not exceed the maximum allowed length.
* Use a safer string formatting function like strftime() or asctime() to limit the output string length.
* Use a buffer size limit when reading input strings to prevent buffer overflows.

Additionally, it is recommended to use secure coding practices and input validation techniques to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
