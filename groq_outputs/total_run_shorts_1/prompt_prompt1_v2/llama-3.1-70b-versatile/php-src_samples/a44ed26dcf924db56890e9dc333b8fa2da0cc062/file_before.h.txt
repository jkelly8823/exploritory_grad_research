VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a header file for a C/C++ program that deals with file magic numbers. It defines several macros, constants, and function prototypes. The code is mostly dealing with data structures and function declarations, and there are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this snippet.

However, it is worth noting that the use of bitwise operations and macros can sometimes lead to confusion and make the code harder to understand. Additionally, the lack of error handling and input validation in some of the function prototypes could potentially be a concern. But without the implementation details of these functions, it's hard to say for certain whether there are any vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as no vulnerabilities were found.
