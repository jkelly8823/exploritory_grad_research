VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a switch statement handling different opcode operations. It checks for exact matches between characters and increments the pointers accordingly. Although the code does not perform any error checking on the input pointers `p` and `s`, this snippet itself does not contain any clear vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or format string attacks. However, without the larger context of the codebase, the potential for issues stemming from pointer manipulation cannot be completely ruled out.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, based on the code snippet provided. However, consider adding additional error checking and validation for the input pointers `p` and `s` to prevent potential issues such as null pointer dereferences or buffer overflows in the larger codebase.
ORIGINAL CODE:


    break;

    case OP_EXACT1:  MOP_IN(OP_EXACT1);
      DATA_ENSURE(1);
      if (*p != *s) goto fail;
      p++; s++;
      MOP_OUT;
      break;

    case OP_EXACT1_IC:  MOP_IN(OP_EXACT1_IC);
