VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Usage of insecure hashing algorithm (SHA-1) for cryptographic operations.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet specifies the hashing algorithm 'sha1' as the default for signing certificates. SHA-1 is an outdated and insecure hashing algorithm that has known vulnerabilities and has been widely deprecated for use in secure cryptographic operations. 

The SHA-1 hashing algorithm was first deprecated by NIST in 2002, and many prominent organizations and software have stopped supporting SHA-1 due to its insecurity. SHA-1 has been shown to have multiple vulnerabilities, including collision attacks which can be exploited by attackers to compromise the integrity of signed certificates.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace 'sha1' with a secure hashing algorithm such as 'sha256', 'sha384', or 'sha512', to ensure the integrity and security of the signed certificates. Additionally, use a secure randomly generated salt and consider implementing additional security measures to prevent potential attacks.
