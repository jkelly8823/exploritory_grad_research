VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identifiable vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of a larger data structure used for storing entity information, possibly for HTML5 parsing. It defines an array of structures containing a code point and a corresponding string representation. Our analysis did not find any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. The code does not seem to perform any dynamic operations or memory allocations that could be prone to common web application security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are provided, as no vulnerabilities were identified in the code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
{ {0x0FE00,	"varsupsetneqq",      	13} },
};
static const entity_multicodepoint_row multi_cp_html5_02AFD[] = {
	{ {01,		NULL                  ,	0} },
	{ {0x0FE00,	"varsupsetneqq",      	13} },
};
/* End of double code point tables }}} */
