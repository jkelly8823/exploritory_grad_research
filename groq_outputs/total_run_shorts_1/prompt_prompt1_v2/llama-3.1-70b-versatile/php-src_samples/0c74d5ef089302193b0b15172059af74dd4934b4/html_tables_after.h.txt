VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of C code defining arrays of structures for HTML5 entities. After thoroughly analyzing the code snippet, I did not find any obvious vulnerabilities. The code defines two arrays, one with a single element, and another with two elements. The code does not contain any dynamic memory allocation, user input handling, or potential buffer overflow scenarios. Based on this limited analysis, I conclude that no vulnerabilities are present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
