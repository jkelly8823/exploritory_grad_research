VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 28
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insufficient Error Handling and Resource Management.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, it appears that there are two separate instances of SSL handle creation using OpenSSL. However, both instances have incomplete error handling and resource management. 

When an error occurs during the creation of the SSL handle, only a warning is thrown (lines 11 and 28). However, this does not necessarily mean that the error is handled properly, and any subsequent execution of the code may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.

Additionally, there does not appear to be any cleanup of allocated resources in the event of a failure to create the SSL handle, potentially leading to resource leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these issues, it is recommended that:

* Instead of just throwing a warning and continuing with execution, return an error or break out of the function to prevent any potential undefined behavior.
* Any allocated resources should be cleaned up in the event of a failure to create the SSL handle.
* Consider using a more robust error handling system, such as using exceptions instead of error codes.
