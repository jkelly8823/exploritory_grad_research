VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Disclosure Vulnerability through OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.8xf.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presented allows the setting of the SSL options with `SSL_OP_ALL` when the OpenSSL version number is less than 0x0090806fL (OpenSSL 0.9.8xf). However, for versions prior to 0.9.8xf, it is recommended to avoid using `SSL_OP_ALL` as it contains options that can weaken the security of TLS connections, including those that allow for backward compatibility with older versions that are vulnerable to bugs such as POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using `SSL_OP_ALL`, consider setting the necessary and secure options for your TLS connections. For example, `SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2` and `SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3` can be used to disable older and weaker versions of SSL/TLS. Additionally, using the `SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1` and `SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1` options may be recommended based on your specific use case and compatibility requirements.

ORIGINAL CODE:

		return -1;
	}
