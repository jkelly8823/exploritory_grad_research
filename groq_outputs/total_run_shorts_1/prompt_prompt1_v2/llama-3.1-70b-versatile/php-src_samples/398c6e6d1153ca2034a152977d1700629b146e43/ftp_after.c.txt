VULNERABLE_LINES: 26, 35
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure usage of SSL/TLS: SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS is disabled after being set

EXPLANATION:
The code sets `SSL_OP_ALL` as the ssl_ctx_options and then, under the condition `OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x0090605fL`, it disables `SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS` using the bitwise AND operator (`&=`). However, without proper synchronization or thread safety measures, this change might be made by multiple threads, potentially overwriting each other's changes. 

Moreover, there's a high likelihood that multiple SSL handles are being created using the same SSL context with changed options, potentially affecting each other's behavior. The snippet seems to disable `SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS` multiple times for different instances, but doesn't check if it's the same SSL context.

This issue can potentially lead to data corruption, information leakage, or security issues due to improper SSL/TLS handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, we need to ensure proper synchronization and thread safety measures. 
One possible way to solve this problem is by moving `ssl_ctx_options &= ~SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS;` before `SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, ssl_ctx_options);` in a separate, synchronized block of code. This guarantees that all SSL handles created using this context have the same options set.

Additionally, verifying that `SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS` is only disabled once for every SSL context, through inter-thread synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores, may prevent any overwriting or changing of ssl_ctx_options.

Lastly, set SSL options once per SSL context and maintain this through the lifetime of your application to ensure consistent SSL behavior across all parts of the application.
