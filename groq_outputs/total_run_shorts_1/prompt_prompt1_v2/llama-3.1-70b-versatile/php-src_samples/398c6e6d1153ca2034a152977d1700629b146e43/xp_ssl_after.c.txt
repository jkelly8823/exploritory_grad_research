VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Disabling of SSL/TLS protocol features without proper justification.

EXPLANATION:
The code disables the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option for OpenSSL versions greater than or equal to 0x0090605fL. While this option is used to mitigate the BEAST vulnerability, it is still a potential vulnerability when the option is disabled without proper justification. This is because the option is used to disable the appending of empty fragments to TLS/SSL records, which can be exploited by attackers to recover data. In this code snippet, the justification and reasoning behind disabling this option are unclear.

Furthermore, the code is using the `#if` directive to check the version of OpenSSL at compile-time, rather than runtime. This can potentially lead to issues when the code is compiled with a different version of OpenSSL.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Re-evaluate the need to disable the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option and ensure that there is proper justification for doing so. If the justification is valid, consider documenting the reasoning behind the decision.
2. Instead of using the `#if` directive to check the version of OpenSSL at compile-time, consider using a version check at runtime. This will help to prevent potential issues when the code is compiled with a different version of OpenSSL.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	SSL_METHOD *method;
	long ssl_ctx_options = SSL_OP_ALL;
	
	if (sslsock->ssl_handle) {
		if (sslsock->s.is_blocked) {
			php_error_docref(NULL TSRMLS_CC, E_WARNING, "SSL/TLS already set-up for this stream");
		return -1;
	}

#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x0090605fL
	ssl_ctx_options &= ~SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS;
#endif
	SSL_CTX_set_options(sslsock->ctx, ssl_ctx_options);

#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x0090806fL
	{
		zval **val;
