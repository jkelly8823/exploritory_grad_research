VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a series of #define directives that assign binary values to constants representing different optimization passes in a compiler. These directives are used to define flags that can be combined using bitwise operations. There are no apparent vulnerabilities or potential security risks in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are needed as no vulnerabilities were found.
