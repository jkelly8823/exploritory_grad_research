VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack due to the use of string concatenation when adding flags to the 'CFLAGS_OPCACHE' variable. An attacker could manipulate the `configure_module_dirname` variable to inject malicious commands. This is because the `/I` flag is used to specify the include directory in the MSVC compiler, and this directory path is not validated or sanitized before being concatenated and executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure way to add flags to the 'CFLAGS_OPCACHE' variable, such as using an array or a data structure that can handle multiple values without concatenation.
2. Validate and sanitize the `configure_module_dirname` variable to ensure it does not contain any malicious characters or commands.
3. Use a safer way to specify the include directory, such as using an absolute path or a path that is not user-controlled.

ORIGINAL CODE:
ADD_FLAG('CFLAGS_OPCACHE', "/I " + configure_module_dirname);
