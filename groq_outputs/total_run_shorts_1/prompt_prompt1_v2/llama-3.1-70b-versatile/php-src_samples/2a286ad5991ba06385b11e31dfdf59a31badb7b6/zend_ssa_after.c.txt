VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 184-188
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unintended memory access due to potential integer underflow in `zend_ssa_remove_phi_source` function.
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the `predecessors_count` variable being unsigned in the `zend_ssa_remove_phi_source` function. This means that when `predecessors_count` is decremented to zero, it will wrap around to its maximum unsigned value instead of becoming negative. This can cause an unintended memory access when `phi->sources` is accessed with the decremented `pred_offset` and `predecessors_count` values.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, `predecessors_count` should be signed to prevent integer underflow and the correct memory access should be ensured.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static inline void zend_ssa_remove_phi_source(zend_ssa *ssa, zend_ssa_phi *phi, int pred_offset, int predecessors_count) /* {{{ */
{
    int j, var_num = phi->sources[pred_offset];

    predecessors_count--;
    if (pred_offset < predecessors_count) {
        memmove(phi->sources + pred_offset, phi->sources + pred_offset + 1, (predecessors_count - pred_offset) * sizeof(uint32_t));
    }
    ...
```
