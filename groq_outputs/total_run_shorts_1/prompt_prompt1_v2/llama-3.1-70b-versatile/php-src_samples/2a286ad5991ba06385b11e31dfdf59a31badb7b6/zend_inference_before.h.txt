VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No detectable vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a header file for PHP's Zend Engine. It defines two bitflags (`MAY_BE_RC1` and `MAY_BE_RCN`) and a macro (`DEFINE_SSA_OP_HAS_RANGE`) for defining a family of functions.

Upon analyzing the given code, no detectable vulnerabilities were found. The code mainly consists of macro definitions, bitflags, and function prototypes without any actual code implementation. There is no user-controlled data processing or direct memory access to potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided, as no vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
#define MAY_BE_RC1                  (1<<27) /* may be non-reference with refcount == 1 */
#define MAY_BE_RCN                  (1<<28) /* may be non-reference with refcount > 1  */


#define DEFINE_SSA_OP_HAS_RANGE(opN) \
	static zend_always_inline zend_bool _ssa_##opN##_has_range(const zend_op_array *op_array, const zend_ssa *ssa, const zend_op *opline) \
	{ \
                           int                    widening,
                           zend_ssa_var_info     *ret);
