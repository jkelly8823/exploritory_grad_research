VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability found
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, possibly a character encoding or string processing function. The code attempts to allocate memory using a function called `safe_emalloc` and then enters a while loop to process a string. However, no clear vulnerabilities are present within this code snippet. The loop condition and iteration appear safe and there are no obvious buffer overflows or use of potentially vulnerable functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char c, *ret, *d;
char *hex = "0123456789ABCDEF";

ret = safe_emalloc(3, length + (((3 * length)/(PHP_QPRINT_MAXL-9)) + 1), 1);
d = ret;

while (length--) {
    if (((c = *str++) == '\015') && (*str == '\012') && length > 0) {
```
