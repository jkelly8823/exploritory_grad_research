VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated User-Provided Data in HTTP Request

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is constructing an HTTP request using user-provided data ($params) without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow attackers to inject malicious data into the request, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities such as HTTP request smuggling or cross-site scripting (XSS). Specifically, the $params array is merged with the $headers array without any checks, which could lead to arbitrary data being sent in the HTTP request.

Additionally, the code uses the request_data method to make an HTTP request, but it doesn't specify the HTTP method or any validation for the request parameters.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize any user-provided data before using it in an HTTP request. This can be done using data validation libraries or by implementing custom validation logic. Additionally, you should specify the HTTP method and validate the request parameters to prevent arbitrary data injection.

Here is an example of how you could modify the code to use data validation and sanitization:

```php
$params = [
    // Validated and sanitized parameters go here
];

$validatedParams = [];
foreach ($params as $key => $value) {
    // Validate and sanitize each parameter
    if (is_string($key) && is_string($value)) {
        $validatedParams[$key] = trim($value);
    }
}

$this->response = new Response(
    $this->getClient($address, $connKeepAlive)->request_data($validatedParams, false)
);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

            return new Response(null, true);
        }
        if (is_null($uri)) {
            $uri = $this->makeSourceFile();
        }

        $params = array_merge(
            [
            ],
            $headers
        );
        try {
            $this->response = new Response(
                $this->getClient($address, $connKeepAlive)->request_data($params, false)
            );
        return $filePath;
    }

    /**
     * @return string
     */
    public function makeSourceFile()
    {
        return $this->makeFile('src.php', $this->code);
    }

    /**
     * @param string|null $msg
     */
    private function message($msg)
