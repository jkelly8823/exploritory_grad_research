VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Disclosure and Uncontrolled Memory Allocation vulnerabilities are present due to missing null pointer checks and potentially tainted data being used.

EXPLANATION:
In lines 2-3 and 5, the variables `script_path_translated`, `ptlen`, `slen`, `env_path_info`, and `pilen` are used without being checked for null values. This could potentially lead to uncontrolled memory allocation and access, causing information disclosure or crashes.
Furthermore, in line 5, it appears that potentially tainted data from `env_path_info` is being used without proper validation, which could introduce additional vulnerabilities.

Additionally, lines 2-3 and 5 use pointer arithmetic without proper checks for integer overflows or underflows. This could also lead to uncontrolled memory access and information disclosure.

Finally, although not as pressing of an issue in this specific example, in line 8, it would generally be safer to verify that `orig_path_info` is null before attempting to access it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Before using any pointers, verify that they are not null to prevent information disclosure and uncontrolled memory access.
Example: `if (script_path_translated != NULL && env_path_info != NULL && ...)`.

Add validation to `env_path_info` and other potentially tainted data to prevent uncontrolled memory access and information disclosure.
Example: `if (env_path_info == NULL || pilen < slen || ...)`.

Incorporate overflow and underflow checks when performing pointer arithmetic to prevent uncontrolled memory access.
Example: `ptlen = (size_t) (pilen - slen); if (ptlen < pilen || ptlen < slen)`.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;
tflag = (slen != 0 && (!orig_path_info || strcmp(orig_path_info, path_info) != 0));
} else {
path_info = (env_path_info && pilen > slen) ? env_path_info + pilen - slen : NULL;
tflag = path_info && (orig_path_info != path_info);
}

if (tflag) {
if (orig_path_info) {
