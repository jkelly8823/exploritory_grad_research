VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
NULL Pointer Dereference and Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to NULL pointer dereference and buffer overflow attacks. 
The variable `path_info` is assigned a value that may be NULL in the case where `env_path_info` is NULL. 
Later, if `orig_path_info` is not NULL, it checks if `orig_path_info` and `path_info` are not equal using the `!=` operator. However, this can cause a NULL pointer dereference if `path_info` is NULL.
Additionally, the lines where `path_info` is assigned values (`script_path_translated + ptlen;` and `env_path_info + pilen - slen;`) could also lead to buffer overflow if `ptlen` or `pilen - slen` is larger than the buffer size of `script_path_translated` or `env_path_info` respectively.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Before using `path_info`, it should be checked if it is not NULL to prevent NULL pointer dereference. 
- To prevent buffer overflow, the code should check if the sum of `ptlen` and `pilen - slen` does not exceed the buffer size of `script_path_translated` and `env_path_info` respectively.
- Use bounds checking when working with strings to avoid buffer overflow.

ORIGINAL CODE:
								path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;
								tflag = (slen != 0 && (!orig_path_info || strcmp(orig_path_info, path_info) != 0));
							} else {
								path_info = env_path_info ? env_path_info + pilen - slen : NULL;
								tflag = (orig_path_info != path_info);
							}

							if (tflag) {
								if (orig_path_info) {
