VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This is because the 'substituteEntities' property is set to true and the 'load' method is used to parse untrusted XML files.

EXPLANATION:
The 'substituteEntities' property is used to control the handling of entities in the XML document. When set to true, it allows the parser to replace entities in the XML document with their corresponding values. However, this can also lead to an XXE attack if an attacker can supply malicious XML that includes entities that reference external resources.

In this code snippet, the 'load' method is used to parse four different XML files. However, I did not see any validation or sanitization of these XML files, which means that an attacker could potentially supply malicious XML that includes entities that reference external resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the XML files before parsing them. Additionally, the 'substituteEntities' property should be set to false unless there is a specific requirement to allow entity substitution.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to address this vulnerability:

```php
$domDocument = new DOMDocument();
$domDocument->substituteEntities = false; // Set substituteEntities to false by default
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true); // Disable entity loading for security
$domDocument->load(dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . "dom.xml");
var_dump($domDocument->doctype->internalSubset);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$domDocument = new DOMDocument();
$domDocument->substituteEntities = true;
$domDocument->load(dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . "bug67081_0.xml");
var_dump($domDocument->doctype->internalSubset);

$domDocument = new DOMDocument();
$domDocument->substituteEntities = true;
$domDocument->load(dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . "bug67081_1.xml");
var_dump($domDocument->doctype->internalSubset);

$domDocument = new DOMDocument();
$domDocument->substituteEntities = true;
$domDocument->load(dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . "bug67081_2.xml");
var_dump($domDocument->doctype->internalSubset);

$domDocument = new DOMDocument();
$domDocument->substituteEntities = true;
$domDocument->load(dirname(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . "dom.xml");
var_dump($domDocument->doctype->internalSubset);
```
