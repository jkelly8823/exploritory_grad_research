VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No detected vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is a set of type definitions and constant definitions in a C-style language. It defines an integer type (cdf_secid_t) and several constants related to loop and element limits as well as special values for a security ID. After reviewing the code, no vulnerabilities have been detected. The code appears to be well-structured and does not introduce any security risks that I could identify.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
