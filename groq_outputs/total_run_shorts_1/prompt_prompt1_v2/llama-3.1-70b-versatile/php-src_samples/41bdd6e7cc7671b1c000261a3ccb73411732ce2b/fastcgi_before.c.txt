VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Vulnerability to Information Disclosure via gethostbyname Function.
EXPLANATION:
The gethostbyname function is used to retrieve information about a host from the DNS system. However, this function does not handle DNS resolutions securely, particularly in the case of DNS spoofing attacks. If the DNS response is tampered with, an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary data into the DNS response, allowing them to inject malicious data into the application. 
Furthermore, it's worth noting that gethostbyname function is considered deprecated since POSIX.1-2001 in favor of more modern and secure functions like getaddrinfo.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider replacing the gethostbyname function with getaddrinfo. This function is more secure and handles DNS resolutions more robustly, providing better protection against DNS spoofing attacks.

Additionally, you can use the resolv_conf function to resolve DNS queries with better security. This function also checks for spoofed responses and reports the error.

Another recommendation would be to validate the DNS response before processing it. However, for simplicity and better handling, it would be wise to choose getaddrinfo or other modern and secure functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
			if (sa.sa_inet.sin_addr.s_addr == INADDR_NONE) {
				struct hostent *hep;

				hep = gethostbyname(host);
				if (!hep || hep->h_addrtype != AF_INET || !hep->h_addr_list[0]) {
					fprintf(stderr, "Cannot resolve host name '%s'!\n", host);
					return -1;
				} else if (hep->h_addr_list[1]) {
