VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Buffer overflow vulnerability due to using `strlen(string)` with no boundary checks before calling `gethostbyname(string)`.

EXPLANATION:
The `gethostbyname` function is used to resolve a hostname to an IP address. However, it does not perform any boundary checks on the input string. 
The `strlen(string)` function is used to check if the hostname is longer than `MAXHOSTNAMELEN`, but this does not prevent the buffer overflow. 
The `inet_aton` function checks if the string is a valid IPv4 address. However, if it's not, and the hostname is longer than `MAXHOSTNAMELEN`, calling `gethostbyname(string)` can result in a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this buffer overflow vulnerability, ensure that the input string is null-terminated and its length is bounded before calling `gethostbyname(string)`. 
You can use a safer alternative like `gethostbyname2` which takes an AF (Address Family) argument. However, since you are dealing with IP Version 6 (as indicated by the `AF_INET6` macro) consider using the `getaddrinfo` function instead of `gethostbyname`, which does handle both IPv4 and IPv6.
To prevent null-termination vulnerabilities, ensure that your string is properly null-terminated.
