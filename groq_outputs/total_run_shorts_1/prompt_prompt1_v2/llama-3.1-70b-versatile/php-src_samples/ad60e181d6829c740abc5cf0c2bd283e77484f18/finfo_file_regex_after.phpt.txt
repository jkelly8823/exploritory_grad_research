VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The line of code `<?php require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/skipif.inc');` is vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack, specifically a directory traversal attack. This vulnerability is present because the `dirname(__FILE__)` and `../` path components can potentially allow an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server if there are improper directory permission settings or if the attacker is able to manipulate the `__FILE__` constant. Although this specific code snippet does not necessarily include user-supplied input, it may potentially include malicious files on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Sanitize and validate the file paths that `require_once` is accessing to ensure it cannot access malicious files.
2. Implement proper directory permissions settings to restrict access to sensitive parts of the server.
3. Instead of using `require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/skipif.inc')`, use `require_once __DIR__ . '/skipif.inc'` to limit the risk of a directory traversal attack by relying on the `__DIR__` magic constant. This constant returns the directory of the file and will not be vulnerable to the same directory traversal attacks.
