VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a preprocessor directive that checks if the `PHP_CAN_SUPPORT_PROC_OPEN` symbol is defined. This is not an executable piece of code and does not pose any immediate vulnerability. It is a conditional check for platform-specific functionality and does not contain any dynamically generated input or potential buffer overflows. As a result, it does not pose an immediate risk of security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no recommendations for this specific code snippet, as it does not pose any immediate security vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the functionality under this conditional compile is correctly implemented to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
ORIGINAL CODE:


/* This symbol is defined in ext/standard/config.m4.
 * Essentially, it is set if you HAVE_FORK || PHP_WIN32
 * Other platforms may modify that configure check and add suitable #ifdefs
 * around the alternate code.
 * */
#ifdef PHP_CAN_SUPPORT_PROC_OPEN
