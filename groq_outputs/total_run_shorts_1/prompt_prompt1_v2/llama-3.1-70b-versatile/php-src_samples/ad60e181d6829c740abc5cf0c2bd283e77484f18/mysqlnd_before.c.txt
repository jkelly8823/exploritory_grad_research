VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to improper handling of dynamically allocated memory.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses various functions like `mnd_pestrdup`, `mnd_emalloc`, `mnd_pemalloc`, `mnd.efree` to allocate and free memory. However, the memory is not always properly checked for `NULL` before being used, and in some cases, the memory is freed twice.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Always check for `NULL` before using dynamically allocated memory.
2. Avoid freeing memory twice. Ensure that the same memory is not freed by multiple functions.
3. Use memory debugging tools like Valgrind to identify memory leaks and corruption.

Specifically:

* In the `mysqlnd_connect_run_authentication` function, the `plugin_data` is allocated with `mnd_emalloc` and then freed with `mnd_efree`. However, the same memory is assigned to `switch_to_auth_protocol_data` and later freed again with `mnd_efree`. This can lead to memory corruption. (Lines 336-346)
* In the `mysqlnd_conn_data::change_user` function, the `plugin_data` is allocated with `mnd_emalloc` and then freed with `mnd_efree`. However, if `scrambled_data` is `NULL`, the `plugin_data` is not freed, leading to a potential memory leak. (Lines 351-380)
* In the `mysqlnd_conn_data::simple_command` function, the `cmd_packet` is freed with `PACKET_FREE`, but it is not checked if it is `NULL` before being freed. This can lead to a segmentation fault if `cmd_packet` is `NULL`. (Lines 149-170)

By fixing these issues, the code can be made more robust and less prone to memory corruption.
