VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a test case for a PHP bug fix. It checks if the system uses 32-bit wide long integers and skips the test if this condition is met. The code snippet is simple and does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities, such as user input validation issues, sensitive information leaks, or insecurity vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
--TEST--
Bug #62097: fix for bug #54547 is wrong for 32-bit machines
--SKIPIF--
<?php
if (PHP_INT_MAX !== 2147483647)
	die('skip for system with 32-bit wide longs only');
--FILE--
<?php
```
Note: Since the code snippet provided is only a fragment and appears to be part of a test case, I focused on detecting potential vulnerabilities in this context. It's essential to evaluate the entire codebase to ensure its overall security.
