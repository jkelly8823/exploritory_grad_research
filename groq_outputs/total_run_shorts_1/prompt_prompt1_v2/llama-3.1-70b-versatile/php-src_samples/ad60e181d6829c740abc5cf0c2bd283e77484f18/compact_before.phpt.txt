VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Input not properly handled
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check for multi-byte or non-ASCII characters within the variable name $çity. PHP before version 7.0 was vulnerable to a heap overflow vulnerability caused by overrunning the buffer for the internal function php_varname, when used on variables with names containing UTF-8 characters.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use ASCII characters for variable names to ensure consistent behavior in PHP. Consider using PHP versions 7.0 or above as they have removed support for overloading on UTF-8 characters in variable names.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<?php

$çity  = "San Francisco";
