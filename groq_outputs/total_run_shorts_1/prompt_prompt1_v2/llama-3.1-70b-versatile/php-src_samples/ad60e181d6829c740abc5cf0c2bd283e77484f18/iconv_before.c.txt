VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow in String Manipulation Functions

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains various instances of string manipulation operations where a buffer overflow vulnerability can occur. These instances include using 'sprintf' and 'spprintf' functions with insufficient size checks on the format string and buffer, potentially leading to buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent these buffer overflow vulnerabilities, consider the following:

1. Review and refactor the code to use safer string manipulation functions such as 'snprintf' or 'strlcat', which prevent buffer overflows by limiting the number of bytes written to a buffer.
2. Perform size checks on format strings and buffers to ensure that they are not too small to contain the expected data.
3. Implement measures to prevent precision issues when working with 'int' types and bit shifts.
4. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input data.
