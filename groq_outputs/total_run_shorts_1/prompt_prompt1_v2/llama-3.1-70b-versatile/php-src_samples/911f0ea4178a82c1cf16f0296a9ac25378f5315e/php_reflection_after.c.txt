VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Exposure through Exposed Sensitive Data via Property Docs and Offset

EXPLANATION:
The zend_get_property_info function call checks if a certain property exists, and if it does not, a new zend_property_info structure is created. This new structure contains potentially sensitive information such as the document comment of the property and its memory offset. 

However, this potentially sensitive information is exposed via the `property_info.doc_comment` and the `property_info.offset`. These values could reveal underlying implementation details about the memory layout and internal workings of the application.

Additionally, the use of a hardcoded value (-1) for the `property_info.offset` might, in certain situations, cause unintended behavior if the offset is later used in arithmetic operations without proper bounds checking. The use of hardcoded offset values without description comments could be considered a potential anti-pattern that could make code maintenance more difficult in the future.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
If the intention was to fully conceal the existence and properties of a class' internal properties, implement security hardening mechanisms like defensive programming practices (remove any doc comments and restrict offset access to a narrowly defined range of trusted entities) or consider the use of more robust object encapsulation and decorator pattern implementation techniques.

Additionally, investigate why the property_info.offset is hardcoded to -1. Consider refactoring the code to include proper bounds checking on the offset or dynamically derive the offset.

Consider overwriting sensitive information once it is no longer needed in order to reduce exposure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (zend_get_property_info(ce, hash_key->key, 1) == NULL) {
	zend_property_info property_info;

	property_info.doc_comment = NULL;
	property_info.flags = ZEND_ACC_IMPLICIT_PUBLIC;
	property_info.name = hash_key->key;
	property_info.ce = ce;
	property_info.offset = -1;
}
```
