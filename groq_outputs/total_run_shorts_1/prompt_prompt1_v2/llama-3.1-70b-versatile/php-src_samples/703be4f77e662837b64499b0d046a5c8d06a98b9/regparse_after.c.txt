VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a function that seems to be handling some kind of state machine. The function updates the state and type variables based on certain conditions, but there is no clear indication of potential vulnerabilities.

The code does not seem to involve any user input, data serialization, or external data processing, which are common sources of vulnerabilities. It primarily performs internal state updates and data assignments.

Given the limited scope of the code snippet, it is difficult to identify any potential vulnerabilities. However, without the broader context of the project and the definition of variables like *state and *type, this assessment is based solely on the information available in the snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, to further improve the security of the code, consider the following general suggestions:

* Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and validated before use.
* Use bounds checking and error handling to prevent potential issues.
* Validate user input and sanitize data before processing it.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
