VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a C function, possibly involved in parsing or state management. It assigns values to two pointers (`state` and `type`) and returns an integer value. However, without access to the entire code and variable declarations, I have analyzed this snippet in isolation and could not find any potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were found.
