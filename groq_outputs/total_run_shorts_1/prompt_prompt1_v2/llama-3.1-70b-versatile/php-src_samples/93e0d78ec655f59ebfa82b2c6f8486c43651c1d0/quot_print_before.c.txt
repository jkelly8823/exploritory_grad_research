VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential null pointer dereference and out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises in the line `c = *str++`. Although we do not have the declaration of `str` in the given code snippet, assuming it is a pointer to a character array, this line could potentially access memory beyond the bounds of the array or dereference a null pointer if `str` is null.

Without bounds checking, `str++` may increment the pointer beyond the end of the array, leading to undefined behavior. Similarly, if `str` is null, attempting to dereference it will also result in undefined behavior.

Additionally, the condition `length > 0` checks that `length` is greater than zero before accessing the next character (`*str == '\012'`) but does not prevent accessing the current character (`*str == '\015'`).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure `str` is not null before accessing it. If `str` is null, either handle this condition accordingly or prevent it from reaching this point.
2. Implement bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds access on `str`. Ensure `str` has enough elements before attempting to access its elements.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char c, *ret, *d;
char *hex = "0123456789ABCDEF";

ret = safe_emalloc(1, 3 * length + 3 * (((3 * length)/PHP_QPRINT_MAXL) + 1), 0);
d = ret;

while (length--) {
	if (((c = *str++) == '\015') && (*str == '\012') && length > 0) {
```
