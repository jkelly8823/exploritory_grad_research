VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-23, 39-56, 59-68
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet contains vulnerabilities related to insecure dynamic memory allocation and usage of sensitive data. The potentially vulnerable functions are `var_push_dtor_no_addref` and `object_custom`. These functions allocate memory dynamically using `emalloc` and manipulate the serialized data. However, they do not properly handle errors during the allocation and copying of data.

EXPLANATION:
In lines 15-23 of the function `var_push_dtor_no_addref`, memory is allocated dynamically using `emalloc`. However, the code does not properly handle the case where the memory allocation fails. In such a case, the function will continue to execute and might lead to undefined behavior.

In lines 39-56 of the function `object_custom` (found in an included code segment but not the one presented), sensitive information such as `user_func` and `arg_func_name` is used without proper validation and sanitization. This could potentially lead to issues if the input data is malicious.

In lines 59-68 of the function `object_custom2` and other functions (not directly shown in the snippet but related to the context), sensitive data such as `custom_object`, `class_name`, `elements` is used without proper validation and sanitization.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. To address the dynamic memory allocation vulnerabilities in `var_push_dtor_no_addref`, ensure that proper error handling is implemented for the `emalloc` function. Check the return value of `emalloc` and handle the case where memory allocation fails.

2. To address the sensitive data handling vulnerabilities in `object_custom` and `object_common2`, implement proper validation and sanitization of the input data. This includes checking the type and value of `user_func`, `arg_func_name`, `custom_object`, `class_name`, and `elements` before using them.
