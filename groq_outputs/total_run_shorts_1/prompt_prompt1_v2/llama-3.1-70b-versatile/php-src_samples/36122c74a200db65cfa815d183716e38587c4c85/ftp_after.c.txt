VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential null pointer dereference and use-after-free vulnerability has been identified in the `ftp_get` function. Additionally, the `ftp_getresp` function also has a potential null pointer dereference.

EXPLANATION:
In the `ftp_get` function, the code checks if `ftp` is `NULL` before using it, which is good practice. However, in the `while` loop, the code uses `data->fd` and `data->buf` without checking if `data` is `NULL`. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if `data` is `NULL`. Furthermore, if `data` is `freed` before the `while` loop, using `data` in the loop can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

In the `ftp_getresp` function, the code checks if `ftp` is `NULL` before using it, but then does not check its members. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if `ftp` is `NULL` but its members are accessed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize `data` before using it in the `while` loop. Ensure that `data` is properly allocated and checked for `NULL` before using.
```c
databuf_t *data = NULL;
data = malloc(sizeof(databuf_t)); // Initialize data
if (!data) {
    goto bail;
}
```
2. Check if `data` is `NULL` before using its members in the `while` loop.
```c
while ((rcvd = my_recv(ftp, data != NULL ? data->fd : -1, data != NULL ? data->buf : NULL, FTP_BUFSIZE))) {
```
3. In the `ftp_getresp` function, check if `ftp` is `NULL` before accessing its members.
```c
ftp->resp = 0;
```
   becomes
```c
if (ftp) {
    ftp->resp = 0;
    // Rest of the function
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
ftp_get(ftpbuf_t *ftp, php_stream *outstream, const char *path, ftptype_t type, long resumepos TSRMLS_DC)
{
    databuf_t *data = NULL;
    size_t rcvd;
    char arg[11];

    if (ftp == NULL) {
        goto bail;
    }

    while ((rcvd = my_recv(ftp, data->fd, data->buf, FTP_BUFSIZE))) {
        if (rcvd == -1) {
            goto bail;
        }
int
ftp_getresp(ftpbuf_t *ftp)
{
    if (ftp == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }
    ftp->resp = 0;

    while (1) {
```
