VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION: This is a C code snippet that appears to be defining function argument information for two functions. There is no indication of any potential vulnerabilities in this code, such as untrusted data being used without proper validation, potential buffer overflows, or lack of bounds checking. This code is essentially just defining the function signatures and does not contain any dynamic or data-dependent operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO_EX(arginfo_number_format, 0, 0, 1)
	ZEND_ARG_INFO(0, number)

	ZEND_ARG_INFO(0, dec_separator)
	ZEND_ARG_INFO(0, thousands_separator)
ZEND_END_ARG_INFO()

ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO(arginfo_fmod, 0)
