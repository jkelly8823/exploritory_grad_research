VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is used for defining PHP version variables and constructing a version string. The code appears to be simple string manipulation and arithmetic operations. There are no signs of potential vulnerabilities such as user input processing, unsecured data transmission, or unvalidated data storage. Given the snippet's simplicity and lack of external interaction, no vulnerabilities were detected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are required, as the code is deemed secure based on the analysis. However, depending on the broader context of the project and potential use cases, it might be beneficial to sanitize and validate the input strings, especially the `PHP_EXTRA_VERSION` variable which may hold arbitrary data.
ORIGINAL CODE:


PHP_MAJOR_VERSION=5
PHP_MINOR_VERSION=5
PHP_RELEASE_VERSION=2
PHP_EXTRA_VERSION="-dev"
PHP_VERSION="$PHP_MAJOR_VERSION.$PHP_MINOR_VERSION.$PHP_RELEASE_VERSION$PHP_EXTRA_VERSION"
PHP_VERSION_ID=`expr [$]PHP_MAJOR_VERSION \* 10000 + [$]PHP_MINOR_VERSION \* 100 + [$]PHP_RELEASE_VERSION`
