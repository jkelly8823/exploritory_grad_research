No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a segment of C code that includes function declarations for a SOAP client. It does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The code only consists of function declarations, and no actual logic is implemented here.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                           char **response, 
                           int   *response_len TSRMLS_DC);

void proxy_authentication(zval* this_ptr, smart_str* soap_headers TSRMLS_DC);
void basic_authentication(zval* this_ptr, smart_str* soap_headers TSRMLS_DC);
#endif
