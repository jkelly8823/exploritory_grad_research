VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities present.
EXPLANATION:
This PHP code is executing a test case for the `fputcsv()` function with a custom delimiter and enclosure, then unsetting the file object and cleaning up. It does not directly interact with user input or execute any commands that would introduce a known vulnerability.

However, it does create a file named `SplFileObject_fputcsv.csv` in the script's current directory. In a different context, if the filename was generated based on user input, this would pose a potential vulnerability, but in this isolated snippet, the filename is hard-coded.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:


echo "*** Testing fputcsv() : with enclosure & delimiter of two chars and file opened in read mode ***\n";

$fo = new SplFileObject('SplFileObject_fputcsv.csv', 'w');

var_dump($fo->fputcsv(array('water', 'fruit'), ',,', '""'));

unset($fo);
?>
--CLEAN--
<?php
unlink('SplFileObject::fputcsv.csv');
?>
