VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow or use-after-free vulnerability through pointer aliasing.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet assigns a pointer `hash` with `hash_len + 1` bytes of allocated memory. However, it then copies `hash_len` bytes into this memory block using `memcpy`. The problem arises from assigning a null character (`hash[hash_len] = 0;`) after the `memcpy` call, which can potentially overflow the buffer if `hash_len` is equal to the allocated size. 

Moreover, there is an assignment to `hash[hash_len]` without checking if `hash_len` is within the allocated bounds, which can lead to undefined behavior due to pointer aliasing.

Another issue is the insecure usage of `emalloc`, which can lead to memory leaks or other issues if not used properly. However, this is not immediately exploitable without more context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the allocation size to `hash_len + 1` and use `snprintf` or `strcpy` to safely assign a null-terminated string to `hash`. However, given the use of `memcpy`, it is likely that you want a binary-safe way to assign the value.
2. Validate `hash_len_ptr` before assigning to `*hash_len_ptr` to avoid potential null pointer dereferences.
3. Verify the null character assignment, `hash[hash_len] = 0;` is intended and within the allocated bounds.
4. Review the code to ensure proper memory management and deallocation.

ORIGINAL CODE:

		return (char*)&Z_OBJVAL_P(obj);
#else
		char *hash = emalloc(hash_len + 1);

		zend_object_value zvalue;
		memset(&zvalue, 0, sizeof(zend_object_value));
		zvalue.handle = Z_OBJ_HANDLE_P(obj);
		zvalue.handlers = Z_OBJ_HT_P(obj);

		memcpy(hash, (char *)&zvalue, hash_len);
		hash[hash_len] = 0;

		if (hash_len_ptr) {
			*hash_len_ptr = hash_len;
