VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3, 9, 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability in memory allocation and copying.
EXPLANATION:
The code has several instances of memory allocation and copying without proper bounds checking. 
In lines 1 and 3, the function 'pemalloc' is used to dynamically allocate memory without checking if the allocation was successful, which could lead to a null pointer dereference.
In line 9, the 'memmove' function is used to copy data into 'client->request.content' without checking if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data.
In line 16, the 'memmove' function is used to copy data into 'header_name' without checking if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data.
This lack of bounds checking could lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always check the return value of 'pemalloc' to ensure the memory allocation was successful.
- Use 'realloc' instead of 'pemalloc' and 'memmove' to resize the buffer and prevent overflow.
- Ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data before copying it.
- Consider using safer functions like 'strcpy_s' or 'strncpy' instead of 'memmove' for string operations.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
size_t prev_patch_len;
int  is_static_file = 0;

if (!buf) {
	return;
}

memmove(p, document_root, document_root_len);
p += document_root_len;
vpath = p;
if (request->vpath_len > 0 && request->vpath[0] != '/') {
php_cli_server_client *client = parser->data;
if (!client->request.content) {
	client->request.content = pemalloc(parser->content_length, 1);
	if (!client->request.content) {
		return -1;
	}
	client->request.content_len = 0;
}
memmove(client->request.content + client->request.content_len, at, length);
client->request.content_len += length;
}
if (client->current_header_name) {
	char *header_name = safe_pemalloc(client->current_header_name_len, 1, 1, 1);
	if (!header_name) {
		return -1;
	}
	memmove(header_name, client->current_header_name, client->current_header_name_len);
	client->current_header_name = header_name;
	client->current_header_name_allocated = 1;
}
