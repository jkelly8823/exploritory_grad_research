VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The $uri and $query parameters are directly assigned to the $params array and then passed to the request function, which may expose a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability and potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: 
SSRF vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to manipulate a server into accessing or communicating with a URL chosen by the attacker, which may lead to disclosure of sensitive data or the attack of internal systems. In this code, the $uri and $query parameters are not being sanitized before being passed to the request function. An attacker could manipulate these parameters to perform SSRF attacks. 

Furthermore, the $headers array can also be manipulated. XSS vulnerabilities can occur if unsanitized user input is passed to the request function through these headers, which can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the $uri and $query parameters to ensure they adhere to expected formats and cannot be manipulated by an attacker to access unauthorized URLs.
- Validate the $headers array to ensure it only contains expected keys and values to prevent the potential injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- Consider using a whitelisting approach to explicitly define the allowed headers and parameters.
- Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.
