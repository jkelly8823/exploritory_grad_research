VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential integer overflow in chunk calculation.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises in the calculation of the `chunks` and `restlen` variables. The variables are declared as integers, and the values assigned to them are the result of integer division and multiplication. However, in some cases, the intermediate results of these operations could exceed the maximum value that an integer can hold, causing an integer overflow. For instance, if `srclen` is large and `chunklen` is 1, `chunks` could overflow, leading to incorrect results or undefined behavior. Furthermore, the subsequent calculation of `out_len` also uses integer multiplication and addition, which could also lead to an overflow if the intermediate results are large.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for potential integer overflows before performing calculations.
2. Use a larger data type to hold the intermediate results of the calculations. For example, use `long long` instead of `int` for `chunks` and `restlen`.
3. Validate the input values `srclen` and `chunklen` to prevent large values that could lead to overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	char *p, *q;
	int chunks; /* complete chunks! */
	int restlen;
	float out_len; 

	chunks = srclen / chunklen;
	restlen = srclen - chunks * chunklen; /* srclen % chunklen */

	out_len = chunks + 1;
	out_len *= endlen;
	out_len += srclen + 1;

	if (out_len > INT_MAX || out_len <= 0) {
		return NULL;
	}

	dest = safe_emalloc((int)out_len, sizeof(char), 0);

	for (p = src, q = dest; p < (src + srclen - chunklen + 1); ) {
		memcpy(q, p, chunklen);
		q += chunklen;
