VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Data Wipe and Potential Buffer Overflow

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet includes a function `php_crypt_blowfish_rn` that handles a Blowfish encryption process. The vulnerability arises in how the function handles its memory. The code attempts to securely clean sensitive data from its stack using the `clean` function; however, it does not properly secure the stack by zeroing the local variables with sensitive data in this function.
More specifically, this vulnerability stems from lack of initialization before use with theBF_word variable `count`.

However, the immediate threat is based on bf_word and missing a size parameter within BF_encode.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, include proper initialization before using variables. Specifically, make sure to initialize the BF_word variable `count`. Include a size parameter within BF_encode or properly validate its input to prevent potential buffer overflows.

Additionally, considering using a more secure method for handling sensitive data, such as utilizing a secure random number generator or a cryptographic library that provides secure encryption and decryption functions.

Considering the specific data left on the stack is difficult to secure completely in the absence of stack protectors like canaries, you should consider protecting against these potential spills when handling functions sensitive to information disclosure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Although this code sample spans four functions, the specific areas regarding the data secure initialization,BF_word andBF_encode, are provided in the immediately following


 BF_set_key  {
tmp=0;
...
}
BF_encode(&output[7 + 22], data.binary.output, 23);

 char * php_crypt_blowfish_rn  {BF_word count = (BF_word)1 ...
BF_encode        &output[7 + 22], data(binary.output, 23); ...
clean(&data, sizeof(data));

Given the absense of BF_word and BF_set_key, both requiring BF_word 3 and 4 BF_word declarations  and an extra line showing missing size param BF_encode, it can be determined from context.
