VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack through the atof() family of functions, specifically due to the use of the atoi() function on untrusted user input from php_optarg.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the atoi() function does not perform any error checking or bounds checking on the input data it receives. This makes it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks when handling large input data.

In particular, the variable php_optarg is part of the OPTS structure used by the php_getopt() function, and may contain untrusted data sourced from the user through the environment variables or from other external sources.

If an attacker is able to craft an input value that overflows the input buffer when being passed to the atoi() function, they could potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a safer alternative to the atoi() function should be used instead. A safer alternative would be the strtol() function. This function has built-in error checking and bounds checking capabilities that help prevent buffer overflow attacks. Additionally, validation and sanitization of the user input should be performed to prevent any malicious activity.

Here's a sample code to demonstrate how the strtol() function can be used as a safer alternative:

    char *endptr;
    long value = strtol(php_optarg, &endptr, 10);

    if (errno == ERANGE || value == LONG_MIN) {
        /* Handle underflow condition. */
    } else if (errno == ERANGE || value == LONG_MAX) {
        /* Handle overflow condition. */
    } else {
        repeats = (int)value;
    }

ORIGINAL CODE:

	if((query_string = getenv("QUERY_STRING")) != NULL && strchr(query_string, '=') == NULL) {
		/* we've got query string that has no = - apache CGI will pass it to command line */
		unsigned char *p;
		decoded_query_string = strdup(query_string);
		php_url_decode(decoded_query_string, strlen(decoded_query_string));
		for (p = decoded_query_string; *p &&  *p <= ' '; p++) {
			/* skip all leading spaces */
		}
		if(*p == '-') {
			skip_getopt = 1;
		}
		free(decoded_query_string);
	}
	}

	zend_first_try {
		while (!skip_getopt && (c = php_getopt(argc, argv, OPTIONS, &php_optarg, &php_optind, 1, 2)) != -1) {
			switch (c) {
				case 'T':
					benchmark = 1;
					repeats = atoi(php_optarg);
