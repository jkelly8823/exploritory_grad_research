VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in php_parserr function.

EXPLANATION:
The php_parserr function is vulnerable to buffer overflow when handling DNS_T_TXT records. The code does not properly validate the length of the TXT record data. If the record data is longer than expected, it can cause a buffer overflow when copying the data to the tp buffer. The vulnerability exists in two places: in the handling of TXT records and in the handling of A6 records.

The memcpy function is used to copy the TXT record data to the tp buffer. However, the length of the data is not properly validated. The length is obtained from the DNS record data, which can be forged by an attacker. If the length is too large, it can cause a buffer overflow.

Similarly, in the handling of A6 records, the GETSHORT function is used to obtain the length of the record data. However, this length is not validated, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the code should validate the length of the TXT record data and the A6 record data before copying it to the tp buffer. The validation should ensure that the length does not exceed the size of the tp buffer.

Here's an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```c
// Validate the length of the TXT record data
if (l2 + n > dlen) {
    // Handle error or truncate the data
}

// ...

// Validate the length of the A6 record data
if ((n + 8) / 16 + i > 8) {
    // Handle error or truncate the data
}
```

Additionally, the code should use safer functions like strcpy_s or strncpy to copy the data to the tp buffer.
