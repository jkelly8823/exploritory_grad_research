VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential Buffer Overflow due to the lack of bounds checking in the memcpy function.

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for the `path_translated` string using `emalloc` and then uses `memcpy` to copy data into that buffer. However, the `memcpy` function does not perform bounds checking, which means that if the `pt` buffer is longer than the length specified by `ptlen`, it can overflow the allocated buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent memory. Additionally, if the `ptlen` variable is not properly validated before being used as an argument to `memcpy`, an attacker may be able to manipulate the value of `ptlen` to trigger an overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a safer function such as `strcpy` or `strncpy` that performs bounds checking and null-terminates the resulting string. Alternatively, `memcpy` can still be used if the bounds are properly checked beforehand. It is also recommended to check the `ptlen` variable before using it to prevent potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. 

Additionally, the code should check if `path_translated` is NULL before using it, to prevent the potential for a segmentation fault in case `emalloc` fails to allocate memory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
) {
  /* PATH_TRANSLATED = PATH_TRANSLATED - SCRIPT_NAME + PATH_INFO */
  int ptlen = strlen(pt) - strlen(env_script_name);
  int path_translated_len = ptlen + (env_path_info ? strlen(env_path_info) : 0);
  char *path_translated = NULL;

  path_translated = (char *) emalloc(path_translated_len + 1);
  memcpy(path_translated, pt, ptlen);
```
