VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No identified vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a preprocessor directive section of a C program. It includes standard library headers, a libtidy header, and provides a definition for a compatibility macro (TIDY_CALL) for older versions of libtidy. 

After examining the code snippet, no obvious vulnerabilities or potential security issues were identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None are needed. However, as this is a small partial code snippet from a larger file, it would be recommended to examine the rest of the file for vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include "ext/standard/info.h"

#include "tidy.h"
#include "buffio.h"

/* compatibility with older versions of libtidy */
#ifndef TIDY_CALL
#define TIDY_CALL
