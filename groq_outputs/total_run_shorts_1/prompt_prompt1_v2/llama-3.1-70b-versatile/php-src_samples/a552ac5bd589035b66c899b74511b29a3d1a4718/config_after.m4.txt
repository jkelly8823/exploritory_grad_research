ORIGINAL CODE:

```m4
if test -z "$TIDY_DIR"; then
  AC_MSG_ERROR(Cannot find libtidy)
else
  dnl Check for tidybuffio.h (as opposed to simply buffio.h)
  dnl which indicates that we are building against tidy-html5
  dnl and not the legacy htmltidy. The two are compatible,
  dnl except for with regard to this header file.
  if test -f "$TIDY_INCDIR/tidybuffio.h"; then
    AC_DEFINE(HAVE_TIDYBUFFIO_H,1,[defined if tidybuffio.h exists])
  fi
fi

TIDY_LIBDIR=$TIDY_DIR/$PHP_LIBDIR
