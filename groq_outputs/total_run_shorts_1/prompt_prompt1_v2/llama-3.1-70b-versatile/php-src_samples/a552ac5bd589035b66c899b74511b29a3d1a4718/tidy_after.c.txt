VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet includes standard C libraries and conditional directives for including Tidy parsing libraries based on the availability of certain headers. The code is clean and properly formatted, without any apparent vulnerabilities or security issues.

The conditional directives (#if, #else, #ifndef, #define) are correctly used to ensure compatibility with different versions of the Tidy library. The code does not contain any obvious holes for common attacks, such as buffer overflows or path traversal attacks. The use of preprocessor directives and conditional compilation also reduces the attack surface.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include "ext/standard/info.h"

#include "tidy.h"

#if HAVE_TIDYBUFFIO_H
#include "tidybuffio.h"
#else
#include "buffio.h"
#endif

/* compatibility with older versions of libtidy */
#ifndef TIDY_CALL
#define TIDY_CALL
