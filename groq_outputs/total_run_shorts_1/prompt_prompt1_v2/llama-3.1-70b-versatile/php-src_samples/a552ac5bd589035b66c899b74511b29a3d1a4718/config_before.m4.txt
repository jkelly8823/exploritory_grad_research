VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a fragment of a shell script, possibly from an Autoconf configuration file. It checks if the `TIDY_DIR` variable is empty and, if so, displays an error message using the `AC_MSG_ERROR` macro. It then sets the value of `TIDY_LIBDIR` to the concatenation of `TIDY_DIR` and `PHP_LIBDIR`.

No potential vulnerabilities, such as command injection, path traversal, or sensitive data exposure, were identified in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations or fixes are necessary for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if test -z "$TIDY_DIR"; then
    AC_MSG_ERROR(Cannot find libtidy)
fi

TIDY_LIBDIR=$TIDY_DIR/$PHP_LIBDIR
```
