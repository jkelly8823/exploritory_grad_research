VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 145-169
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a heap overflow vulnerability. The `make_val` function (`memcpy`) doesn't check if there's enough space in `tp` to hold `dlen + 1` bytes of data. The `ll` variable that keeps track of the current position in `cp` is incremented in an inner loop (`while (ll < dlen)`) and then used to index `cp` in `memcpy` (`cp + ll + 1`), potentially overwriting data that shouldn't be written.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability is concerning because the data being copied into `tp` is sourced from the network (via `cp`). This could allow a malicious actor to control what data is copied to the heap, which in turn could allow for execution of arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The solution is to limit the amount of data copied to `tp` in the `memcpy` function, to be the minimum between `n` and `dlen-ll-1`, like so:

```c
int min_len = ll + n <= dlen ? n : dlen - ll - 1;
memcpy(tp + ll, cp + ll + 1, min_len);
```

This limits the maximum data being copied into `tp` at any given time, preventing potential heap overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
while (ll < dlen) {
    n = cp[ll];
    if ((ll + n) >= dlen) {
        // Invalid chunk length, truncate
        n = dlen - (ll + 1);
    }
    memcpy(tp + ll, cp + ll + 1, n);
    add_next_index_stringl(entries, cp + ll + 1, n, 1);
    ll = ll + n + 1;
}
```
