VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uncontrolled Memory Comparison

EXPLANATION:
The `strcmp` function in the given code snippet is comparing `orig_path_info` with `path_info` using `strcmp`. However, if `orig_path_info` is not null-terminated or is a user-controlled input, this comparison may lead to a memory disclosure or crash. Furthermore, using `strcmp` without bounds checking can lead to a buffer overflow if the strings being compared are not null-terminated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use safe string comparison functions like `strncmp` or `strnlen` along with bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows. Ensure that `orig_path_info` is null-terminated and not user-controlled. Additionally, consider using secure string comparison functions that do not leak timing information, such as `memcmp` with a secure comparison function.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
							path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;
							tflag = (slen != 0 && (!orig_path_info || strcmp(orig_path_info, path_info) != 0));
						} else {
							path_info = env_path_info ? env_path_info + pilen - slen : NULL;
							tflag = (orig_path_info != path_info);
						}

						if (tflag) {
							if (orig_path_info) {
