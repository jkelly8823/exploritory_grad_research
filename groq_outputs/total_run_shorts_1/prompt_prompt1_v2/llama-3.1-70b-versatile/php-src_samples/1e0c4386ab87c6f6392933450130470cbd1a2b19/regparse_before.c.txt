VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerable line does not appear to be the issue here. There is however, integer overflows/underflows concern in this function

EXPLANATION:
The `scan_unsigned_octal_number` function can return a negative value if the number is too big. However, this function returns an error code if this occurs, and stops execution. Thats good. However there is however a deeper issue. We do not have the information on `num` but if it where to cause a integer overflow, this if check would be eliminated and return later, allowing an attacker to overflow this variable `num`. Additionally, `scan_unsigned_octal_number` also is vulnerable if p has no null termination.
 
Similarly, when calling the `add_code_range` function with a range of `*vs` to `*vs`, it could lead to integer underflows/overflows issues even though its checking is handled.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
It's recommended to:
*   Check if the passed octal numbers can cause an integer overflow/underflow in the `num` variable before these scans.
*   Ensure the `p` has a null termination before passing it to `scan_unsigned_octal_number`
*   Consider using a safer way to represent numbers to handle overflow situations better.
*   Validate and handle values of `*vs` being passed to `add_code_range` function to ensure they are within the valid range.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
PUNFETCH;
prev = p;
num = scan_unsigned_octal_number(&p, end, 3, enc);
if (num < 0) return ONIGERR_TOO_BIG_NUMBER;
if (p == prev) {  /* can't read nothing. */
  num = 0; /* but, it's not error */
}
tok->type = TK_RAW_BYTE;
if (IS_SYNTAX_OP(syn, ONIG_SYN_OP_ESC_OCTAL3)) {
  prev = p;
  num = scan_unsigned_octal_number(&p, end, (c == '0' ? 2:3), enc);
  if (num < 0) return ONIGERR_TOO_BIG_NUMBER;
  if (p == prev) {  /* can't read nothing. */
    num = 0; /* but, it's not error */
  }
  tok->type = TK_RAW_BYTE;
  switch (*state) {
  case CCS_VALUE:
    if (*type == CCV_SB)
      BITSET_SET_BIT(cc->bs, (int )(*vs));
    else if (*type == CCV_CODE_POINT) {
      r = add_code_range(&(cc->mbuf), env, *vs, *vs);
      if (r < 0) return r;
```

(Note this the `0` is noted in Vul Line - should really capture the whole of that c source, but vul is not explicitly defined here.
