VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Unsanitized input to the gethostbyname function can lead to DNS rebinding attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The `gethostbyname` function is used to resolve a hostname to an IP address. However, it is not sanitized for proper input validation, which makes it vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. DNS rebinding attacks involve an attacker manipulating the DNS-server's response to point to an IP address under their control, potentially bypassing security mechanisms such as the same-origin policy.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, use the `getaddrinfo` function instead, which allows for more robust validation of hostname and IP address conversions. Additionally, consider implementing input validation and sanitization for the `hostname` variable to prevent malicious input from being passed to the `gethostbyname` function.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	return;
}

	RETURN_STR(php_gethostbyname(hostname));
}
/* }}} */

	return;
}

	hp = gethostbyname(hostname);
	if (hp == NULL || hp->h_addr_list == NULL) {
		RETURN_FALSE;
	}
```
