EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not contain any executable PHP code but appears to be test output or a PHP test case. The "%s" is likely a placeholder for a string that will be inserted during testing. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The mention of CVE-2013-6420 is likely a reference to a known vulnerability, but it does not appear to be applicable to this code snippet. The test case seems to be designed to test if the openssl_x509_parse function properly handles ASN1 data types.
