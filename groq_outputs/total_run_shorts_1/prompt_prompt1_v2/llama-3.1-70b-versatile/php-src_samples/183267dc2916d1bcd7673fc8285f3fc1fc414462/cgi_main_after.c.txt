VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dynamic memory allocation vulnerability and potential buffer overflow in string copying.

EXPLANATION:
This code allocates a new string buffer using dynamic memory allocation with `emalloc` function and copies data into it with `memcpy`. However, there is no bounds checking for the copy operation, which can lead to a potential buffer overflow when copying data to `path_translated`.

The primary issue here is that `memcpy` will copy `ptlen` number of characters into the newly allocated buffer, but there's no guarantee that `path_translated` contains enough room for this data. 

Additionally, the buffer `path_translated` may not be large enough to hold the concatenated string since only `path_translated_len + 1` bytes are allocated for it. The correct allocation size should include space for any additional characters that might be appended later.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- When performing the `memcpy` operation, ensure that `path_translated` is null-terminated after copying. Use `snprintf` instead of `memcpy` to prevent buffer overflows.

- Perform bounds checking to ensure that `path_translated_len` doesn't exceed the allocated memory.

- Make sure that sufficient memory is allocated for potential concatenation or string manipulation.

- Error handling for memory allocation failure is recommended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
) {
    /* PATH_TRANSLATED = PATH_TRANSLATED - SCRIPT_NAME + PATH_INFO */
    int ptlen = strlen(pt) - strlen(env_script_name);
    int path_translated_len = ptlen + (env_path_info ? strlen(env_path_info) : 0);
    char *path_translated = NULL;

    path_translated = (char *) emalloc(path_translated_len + 1);
    memcpy(path_translated, pt, ptlen);
```
