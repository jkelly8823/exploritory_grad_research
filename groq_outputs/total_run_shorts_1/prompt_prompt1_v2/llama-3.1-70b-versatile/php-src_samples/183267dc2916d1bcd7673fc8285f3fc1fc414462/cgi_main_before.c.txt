VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the allocation and memcpy operations. The `path_translated_len` variable is calculated based on the lengths of `pt` and `env_path_info`, but it does not account for the terminating null character that will be added to `path_translated` when it is initialized. This inconsistency in length may lead to a mismatch in buffer sizes. 

Additionally, there is no validation of the lengths of `pt` and `env_path_info` to ensure they are within reasonable bounds for memory allocation. 

In the memcpy operation, it is possible that the `ptlen` exceeds the length of `path_translated`, which is set as `ptlen + env_path_info ? strlen(env_path_info) : 0`. This may lead to overwriting beyond the allocated buffer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the length calculations for `path_translated_len` accurately reflect the buffer size, considering both the lengths of `pt` and `env_path_info`, as well as the terminating null character.
- Validate the lengths of `pt` and `env_path_info` before using them in memory allocation operations.
- Consider using safer string manipulation functions like `strcpy_s` or `snprintf` that prevent buffer overflow.
- It is also worth noting that malloc can fail. You should always check for the validity of the allocated pointer.

ORIGINAL CODE:
)
{
    /* PATH_TRANSLATED = PATH_TRANSLATED - SCRIPT_NAME + PATH_INFO */
    int ptlen = strlen(pt) - strlen(env_script_name);
    int path_translated_len = ptlen + env_path_info ? strlen(env_path_info) : 0;
    char *path_translated = NULL;

    path_translated = (char *) emalloc(path_translated_len + 1);
    memcpy(path_translated, pt, ptlen);
