VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8, 13, 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A double-free vulnerability is present in this code snippet. This occurs when the `zend_string_init` function is called multiple times with the same memory location for the `token` and `token_pos` parameters.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of a parsing function that handles a formatted string. The vulnerability is present in the repeated calls to `zend_string_init` with the `token` and `token_pos` parameters, without freeing the memory allocated by the previous calls. This can lead to a double-free vulnerability, where the same memory location is freed multiple times, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

In the `state == 0 || state == 1` block, `zend_string_init` is called with `token` and `token_pos` to initialize `fld_name`. Later, in the `state == 3` block, `zend_string_init` is called again with the same `token` and `token_pos` to initialize `fld_val`. This repeated initialization with the same memory location can cause a double-free vulnerability when the memory is freed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, free the memory allocated by `zend_string_init` before reusing the same memory location. This can be achieved by calling `zend_string_free` or `zend_string_release` before calling `zend_string_init` again with the same memory location.

Additionally, consider using a different approach for parsing the string, such as using a single call to `zend_string_init` and then manipulating the resulting string, or using a parser that does not require repeated calls to `zend_string_init`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	int state = 0;
	int crlf_state = -1;
	char *token = NULL;
	size_t token_pos;
	zend_string *fld_name, *fld_val;

	ps = str;
	icnt = str_len;
				}

				if (state == 0 || state == 1) {
					if(token) {
						fld_name = zend_string_init(token, token_pos, 0);
					}
					state = 2;
				} else {

					case 3:
						if (crlf_state == -1) {
							if(token) {
								fld_val = zend_string_init(token, token_pos, 0);
							}

							if (fld_name != NULL && fld_val != NULL) {
		state = 3;
	}
	if (state == 3) {
		if(token) {
			fld_val = zend_string_init(token, token_pos, 0);
		}
		if (fld_name != NULL && fld_val != NULL) {
			zval val;
