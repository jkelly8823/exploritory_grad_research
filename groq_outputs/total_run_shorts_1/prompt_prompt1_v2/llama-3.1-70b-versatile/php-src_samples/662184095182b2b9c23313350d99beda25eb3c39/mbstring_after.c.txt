VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 17, 24
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper use of memory through repeated initialization and reassignment without proper memory management.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the repeated initialization and reassignment of the `fld_name` and `fld_val` variables using `zend_string_init()`. The Zend engine's memory management system is used to initialize these variables, but the same variables are reassigned multiple times without properly releasing the previously allocated memory. This can cause memory leaks, making the program vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. Additionally, this repeated reinitialization can also lead to potential use-after-free bugs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is essential to properly manage memory allocation and deallocation. The `zend_string_free()` function should be used to release any allocated memory before reinitializing these variables. It is also recommended to use smart pointers or other automatic memory management mechanisms to prevent memory leaks.

ORGIGINAL CODE:
```c
int state = 0;
int crlf_state = -1;
char *token = NULL;
size_t token_pos = 0;
zend_string *fld_name, *fld_val;

ps = str;
icnt = str_len;
}

if (state == 0 || state == 1) {
    if(token && token_pos > 0) {
        fld_name = zend_string_init(token, token_pos, 0);
    }
    state = 2;
} else {

    case 3:
        if (crlf_state == -1) {
            if(token && token_pos > 0) {
                fld_val = zend_string_init(token, token_pos, 0);
            }

            if (fld_name != NULL && fld_val != NULL) {
        state = 3;
    }
if (state == 3) {
    if(token && token_pos > 0) {
        fld_val = zend_string_init(token, token_pos, 0);
    }
    if (fld_name != NULL && fld_val != NULL) {
        zval val;
```
