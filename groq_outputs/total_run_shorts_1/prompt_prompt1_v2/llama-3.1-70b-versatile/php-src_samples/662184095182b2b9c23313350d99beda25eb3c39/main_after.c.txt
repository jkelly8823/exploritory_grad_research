VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses an indirect object reference as a function argument without proper validation, potentially allowing arbitrary function calls and leading to vulnerabilities such as object injection attacks.
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the use of zend_set_utility_values with an unvalidated address argument (&zuv). Given that the type and source of zuv is not explicitly defined within this snippet, it poses a threat as it might hold arbitrary values, compromising the control flow and behavior of the zend_set_utility_values function call.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure the zuv variable and any value members are properly initialized, validated, and sanitized. Validate the structure of the zuv object before passing its address to zend_set_utility_values. Implement proper access control and data sanitation to ensure that the provided address is not modifiable to a malicious location in memory. Finally, consider using a safer alternative function if possible.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	zuv.html_errors = 1;
	zuv.import_use_extension = ".php";
	zuv.import_use_extension_length = (uint)strlen(zuv.import_use_extension);
	php_startup_auto_globals();
	zend_set_utility_values(&zuv);
	php_startup_sapi_content_types();
