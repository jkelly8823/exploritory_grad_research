VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an Unvalidated Redirect vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious URL.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises in the lines where a response object is created with a filename returned by the `makeSourceFile` method. This filename is used as a file path, which is then used to request data. Since the filename is generated based on the user-input code and headers, an attacker can manipulate the code and headers to redirect the request to an arbitrary URL.

The lack of validation and sanitization on the user-input data makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious data, potentially leading to an Unvalidated Redirect attack. This can be leveraged to perform phishing attacks or even lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, it's essential to validate and sanitize user input before using it to generate file paths or make requests. Here are some recommendations:

- Validate and sanitize the `$code` and `$headers` variables before passing them to the `makeSourceFile` method.
- Implement a whitelist or a validation mechanism to ensure that the file path generated by `makeSourceFile` is within a trusted directory.
- Consider using a secure file storage mechanism instead of generating file paths based on user input.
- Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks if the code is interacting with a database.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
return new Response(null, true);
}
if (is_null($uri)) {
    $uri = $this->makeSourceFile();
}

$params = array_merge(
    [
    ],
    $headers
);
try {
    $this->response = new Response(
        $this->getClient($address, $connKeepAlive)->request_data($params, false)
    );
return $filePath;
}

/**
 * @return string
 */
public function makeSourceFile()
{
    return $this->makeFile('src.php', $this->code);
}

/**
 * @param string|null $msg
 */
private function message($msg)
```
