VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) due to unvalidated client input.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) because it uses unvalidated client input to construct a request. The `$params` variable, which is derived from the `$headers` array, is used to make a request to a URI. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the headers, which makes it possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the request. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.

Additionally, it appears that the code is using the `getClient()` method to obtain a client instance, which is then used to make a request. However, the code does not validate or check the credentials or permissions of the client before making the request. This can also lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the input headers before using them to construct the request. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to filter out any unexpected or malicious headers.

Additionally, it is recommended to validate the credentials or permissions of the client before making the request. This can be achieved by using authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized clients can make requests.

Here is an example of how the `$params` variable can be validated and sanitized:
```php
$params = array_filter($headers, function ($key, $value) {
    return in_array($key, ['Content-Type', 'Accept', 'Authorization']); // Whitelist expected headers
});
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
return new Response(null, true);
}
if (is_null($uri)) {
    $uri = $this->makeFile('src.php', $this->code);
}

$params = array_merge(
    [
    ],
    $headers
);

try {
    $this->response = new Response(
        $this->getClient($address, $connKeepAlive)->request_data($params, false)
    );
return $filePath;
}

/**
 * @param string|null $msg
