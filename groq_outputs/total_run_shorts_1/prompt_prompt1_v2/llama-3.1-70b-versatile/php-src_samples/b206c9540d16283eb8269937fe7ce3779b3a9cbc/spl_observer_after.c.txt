VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbounded Memory Copy Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `memcpy` to copy data from the `&zvalue` address to the `hash` pointer. The third argument to `memcpy` is `hash_len`, which is used as a limit for the number of bytes to be copied. However, there is no validation or bounds checking to ensure that the copied data does not exceed the allocated space for `hash`. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to validate the value of `hash_len` to ensure that it does not exceed the allocated space for `hash`. We can do this by checking if `hash_len` is less than or equal to the size of the allocated memory (`hash_len + 1`). 

```c
if (hash_len <= hash_len + 1) {
    memcpy(hash, (char *)&zvalue, hash_len);
    hash[hash_len] = 0;
} else {
    // handle error: hash_len exceeds allocated space
}
```

Additionally, consider using safer alternatives like `memcpy_s` or `strcpy_s` which can prevent potential buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
return (char*)&Z_OBJVAL_P(obj);
#else
	char *hash = emalloc(hash_len + 1);

	zend_object_value zvalue;
	memset(&zvalue, 0, sizeof(zend_object_value));
	zvalue.handle = Z_OBJ_HANDLE_P(obj);
	zvalue.handlers = Z_OBJ_HT_P(obj);

	memcpy(hash, (char *)&zvalue, hash_len);
	hash[hash_len] = 0;

	if (hash_len_ptr) {
		*hash_len_ptr = hash_len;
```
