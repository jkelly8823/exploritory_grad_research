VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-7, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Double Free vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
We observe in lines 4-7 that memory is allocated to wbmp->bitmap using safe_emalloc. However, this memory is not properly freed before a new allocation is made at line 11 for wbmp->bitmap. The original allocation is also not checked for NULL before the reassignment, potentially leading to loss of data. Although we do not see the definition for safe_emalloc in this code snippet, this double assignment suggests that there is an allocation happening twice for wbmp->bitmap.

Moreover, although we cannot verify this based on this snippet alone, gdFree(wbmp) is called when either allocation fails, without freeing wbmp->bitmap. It is essential to free the wbmp->bitmap in this context to avoid memory leaks.

Finally, we see the potential for double free in the following sequence: if safe_emalloc at line 4 succeeds, but safe_emalloc at line 11 fails, the previously allocated memory at line 4 is not freed before wbmp is freed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Free the memory for wbmp->bitmap before reassigning or overwriting it.
- Use free(wbmp->bitmap) before gdFree(wbmp) when either allocation fails to prevent potential memory leaks and undefined behavior.
- Consider re-examining the implementation of safe_emalloc to avoid double free vulnerability.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if ((wbmp = (Wbmp *) gdMalloc (sizeof (Wbmp))) == NULL)
    return (NULL);

if (overflow2(sizeof (int), width)) {
    gdFree(wbmp);
    return NULL;
  }
if (overflow2(sizeof (int) * width, height)) {
    gdFree(wbmp);
    return NULL;
  }

if ((wbmp->bitmap = (int *) safe_emalloc(sizeof(int), width * height, 0)) == NULL)
    {
      gdFree (wbmp);
      return (NULL);
  printf ("W: %d, H: %d\n", wbmp->width, wbmp->height);
#endif

if (overflow2(sizeof (int), wbmp->width) ||
    overflow2(sizeof (int) * wbmp->width, wbmp->height))
    {
      gdFree(wbmp);
      return (-1);
    }

if ((wbmp->bitmap = (int *) safe_emalloc(wbmp->width * wbmp->height, sizeof(int), 0)) == NULL)
    {
      gdFree (wbmp);
      return (-1);
