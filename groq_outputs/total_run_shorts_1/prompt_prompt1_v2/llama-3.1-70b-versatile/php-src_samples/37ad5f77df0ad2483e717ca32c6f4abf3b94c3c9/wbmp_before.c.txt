VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory Leak Due to Inconsistent Error Handling and Double Allocation.

EXPLANATION:
The code is allocating memory to `wbmp->bitmap` twice. The first allocation on line 3 is not checked for its actual success, as the memory is reassigned on line 9 without any checks. If the first allocation succeeds, and the second fails, the previously allocated memory on line 3 is leaked.

Additionally, when the second allocation fails, the memory allocated to `wbmp` itself is freed using `gdFree(wbmp)`, but the status code returned is inconsistent. On line 5, it returns `NULL`, while on line 11, it returns `-1`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Firstly, avoid reassigning the same pointer without proper deallocation. The allocation on line 9 should be done to a temporary pointer, and then assigned to `wbmp->bitmap` if successful.

Secondly, ensure consistent error handling. If `gdFree(wbmp)` is called, it should be followed by an error code return for consistency.

Lastly, add checks for the first allocation.

```c
  if ((wbmp = (Wbmp *) gdMalloc (sizeof (Wbmp))) == NULL)
    return (NULL);

  int* temp_bitmap;
  if ((temp_bitmap = (int *) safe_emalloc(sizeof(int), width * height, 0)) == NULL)
    {
      gdFree (wbmp);
      return (NULL);
    }
  wbmp->bitmap = temp_bitmap;  // assign if successful

  printf ("W: %d, H: %d\n", wbmp->width, wbmp->height);

  // No need for the second allocation on line 9
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
  if ((wbmp = (Wbmp *) gdMalloc (sizeof (Wbmp))) == NULL)
    return (NULL);

  if ((wbmp->bitmap = (int *) safe_emalloc(sizeof(int), width * height, 0)) == NULL)
    {
      gdFree (wbmp);
      return (NULL);
  printf ("W: %d, H: %d\n", wbmp->width, wbmp->height);
#endif

  if ((wbmp->bitmap = (int *) safe_emalloc(wbmp->width * wbmp->height, sizeof(int), 0)) == NULL)
    {
      gdFree (wbmp);
      return (-1);
```
