VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double-free vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a double-free vulnerability in the 'case 'c'' block. The 'cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override' variable is being freed, but there is no check to ensure it has not already been freed. This can lead to undefined behavior when the program attempts to free the same memory location twice.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a check should be added to ensure that 'cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override' is not NULL before freeing it. This can be done by setting the variable to NULL after it is freed, and checking for NULL before freeing it. The corrected code would look like this:

```c
case 'c':
    if (cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override) {
        free(cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override);
        cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override = NULL;
    }
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
#include "php_main.h"
#include "fopen_wrappers.h"
#include "ext/standard/php_standard.h"

#ifdef PHP_WIN32
# include <io.h>
# include <fcntl.h>
#ifndef PHP_WIN32
	int status = 0;
#endif

#if 0 && defined(PHP_DEBUG)
	/* IIS is always making things more difficult.  This allows
	 * us to stop PHP and attach a debugger before much gets started */
		}
	}

	while ((c = php_getopt(argc, argv, OPTIONS, &php_optarg, &php_optind, 0, 2)) != -1) {
		switch (c) {
			case 'c':
				if (cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override) {
					free(cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override);
