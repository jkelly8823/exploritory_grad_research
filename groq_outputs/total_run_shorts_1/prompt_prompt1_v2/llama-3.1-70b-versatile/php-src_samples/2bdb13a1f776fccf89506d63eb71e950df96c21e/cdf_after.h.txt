VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines an integer type alias and several constants using the `#define` directive. This code is used to establish a set of constants and types for use in a larger program. No obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or insecure function calls, were identified in this snippet. The use of a fixed-size integer type (`int32_t`) for `cdf_secid_t` and the definition of constants do not introduce any known security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
typedef int32_t cdf_secid_t;
