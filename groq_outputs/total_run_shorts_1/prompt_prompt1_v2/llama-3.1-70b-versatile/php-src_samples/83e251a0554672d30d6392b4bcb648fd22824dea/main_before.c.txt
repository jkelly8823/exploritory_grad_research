VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be related to logging or tracing functionality, potentially in an Apache or Nginx environment, given the presence of `SG(request_info)` and `DTRACE_REQUEST_STARTUP/SHUTDOWN` macros. It also contains conditional compilation directives related to DTrace support on Unix-based systems and Windows-specific code. However, there are no apparent vulnerabilities in this snippet. The macro expansions and conditional compilation directives do not contain any obvious security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made as the code appears to be secure in its current form.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int retval = SUCCESS;

#ifdef HAVE_DTRACE
	DTRACE_REQUEST_STARTUP(SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).path_translated), SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_uri), SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_method));
#endif /* HAVE_DTRACE */

#ifdef PHP_WIN32
	PG(com_initialized) = 0;
#endif

#ifdef HAVE_DTRACE
	DTRACE_REQUEST_SHUTDOWN(SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).path_translated), SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_uri), SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_method));
#endif /* HAVE_DTRACE */
}
/* }}} */
