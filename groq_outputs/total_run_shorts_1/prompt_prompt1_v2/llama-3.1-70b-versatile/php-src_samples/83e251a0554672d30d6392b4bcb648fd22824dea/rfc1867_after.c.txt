VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential null pointer dereference vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not perform a null check on the `self` pointer before calling `find_boundary(self, self->boundary TSRMLS_CC)`. This could lead to a null pointer dereference vulnerability if `self` is null. However, it is worth noting that in this code snippet, the variable `self` is checked against null in the function definition itself when calling the function, but we are examining this function definition.

However, a null check is also missing for `self->boundary` which could also cause a null pointer dereference.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a null check for `self` and `self->boundary` before calling `find_boundary(self, self->boundary TSRMLS_CC)`.
   - Example: `if (self == NULL || self->boundary == NULL) { /* handle error */ }`

2. Ensure that `self` and `self->boundary` are properly initialized before calling `multipart_buffer_headers`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int multipart_buffer_headers(multipart_buffer *self, zend_llist *header TSRMLS_DC)
{
	char *line;
	mime_header_entry prev_entry = {0}, entry;
	int prev_len, cur_len;

	/* didn't find boundary, abort */
	if (!find_boundary(self, self->boundary TSRMLS_CC)) {
```
