VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None/Not directly applicable
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Directive injection via php ini directives in a PHP file
EXPLANATION:
Although no specific vulnerabilities were detected in the PHP code provided, the initial lines (--INI--) in the provided PHP file indicate an attempt to set PHP INI directives. These directives, specifically pgsql.log_notice and pgsql.ignore_notices, are typically set in a php.ini file or through .htaccess or httpd.conf files. Allowing these directives within a PHP file could potentially allow attackers to inject settings or exploit existing PHP INI configurations to evade logging and detection.

However, PHP code (php) is executed, and the INI blocks in this snippet are not directly executed. Instead, they likely indicate a change to a php.ini file, potentially within a testing framework or as documentation for expected configuration settings.

Given the snippet provided, no PHP code lines indicate a direct vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Do not allow configuration changes (such as altering ini settings) through PHP code or file includes. These settings should be set in an environment or php.ini file where they can be stringently controlled and validated. PHP INI files or server configuration should not be modified directly in production codebases.

Instead of manipulating INI directives within PHP files, modify your server's configuration (.htaccess, php.ini) manually or handle configuration dynamically through variable assignments and environment variables, depending on your setup. 

Alternatively, investigate if the provided PHP file is using testing frameworks (like PHPT) which use those INI blocks for specific setup 

ORIGINAL CODE:
--INI--
pgsql.log_notice=1
pgsql.ignore_notices=0
--FILE--
