VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not contain any code that would cause a vulnerability. The output appears to be a test expectation for a PHP test. It is expected that an error will occur when calling the `DOMDocument::schemaValidateSource()` method without any arguments. However, this does not indicate a vulnerability, but rather a test to verify that the function behaves correctly under incorrect usage.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
