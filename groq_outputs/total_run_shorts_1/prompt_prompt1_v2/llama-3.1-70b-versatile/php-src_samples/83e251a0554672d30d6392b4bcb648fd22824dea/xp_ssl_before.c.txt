VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential unvalidated return value vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the value of `sslsock->is_client` and then calls `SSL_connect(sslsock->ssl_handle)` depending on the value. However, the return value of `SSL_connect()` is not validated. `SSL_connect()` returns the result of the SSL/TLS handshake, which can be an error. If an error occurs, but the return value is not checked, the program may assume the connection was successful, even when it was not. This can lead to cryptographic operations being performed over an insecure connection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the return value of `SSL_connect()` should be validated to ensure the SSL/TLS handshake was successful. This can be done by checking the return value against possible error values. The OpenSSL documentation should be consulted for the exact error values to check against.

Here's an example of how the code could be fixed:
```c
if (sslsock->is_client) {
    n = SSL_connect(sslsock->ssl_handle);
    if (n <= 0) {
        // Handle SSL connection error
        ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
        // Exit or return error code
    }
} else {
    //...
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
do {
    struct timeval	cur_time,
                    elapsed_time;
    
    if (sslsock->is_client) {
        n = SSL_connect(sslsock->ssl_handle);
    } else {
```
