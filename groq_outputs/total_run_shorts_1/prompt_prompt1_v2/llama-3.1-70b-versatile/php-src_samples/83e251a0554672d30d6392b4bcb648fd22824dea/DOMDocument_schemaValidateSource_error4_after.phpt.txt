VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability is present in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be an expected test result for a PHP test, indicated by the "--EXPECTF--" directive. The warning message suggests that the `DOMDocument::schemaValidateSource()` method is being called with an incorrect number of parameters, but this is not a vulnerability in the code itself. Instead, it appears to be a test case designed to verify that the correct error is produced when this method is called incorrectly. Since this is an expected test case, it does not constitute a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as this is an expected test result and not a vulnerability.
