VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Off-by-one error and potentially uninitialized pointer allocation vulnerability due to use of char *pbuf.
EXPLANATION:
The use of `char *pbuf` with no initialization or allocation can lead to a potentially uninitialized pointer. Additionally, when used with functions like `strcpy()` or `strcat()`, off-by-one errors can occur if the allocated space is not sufficient, leading to buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize and allocate memory for `pbuf` before use. The size of allocation should be determined based on the expected maximum size of data to be stored.
2. Use safer alternatives to `strcpy()` and `strcat()` such as `strcpy_s()` or `strncpy()` and `strcat_s()` or `strncat()` to prevent off-by-one errors.
