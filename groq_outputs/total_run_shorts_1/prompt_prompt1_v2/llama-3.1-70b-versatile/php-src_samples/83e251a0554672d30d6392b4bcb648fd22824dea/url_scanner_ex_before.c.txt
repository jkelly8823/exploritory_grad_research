VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a function declaration for php_url_scanner_add_var, which appears to be related to URL processing in PHP. The function takes several parameters, including name, value, and urlencode flags, and uses a smart_str buffer. The conditional statement checks a struct member 'active' from BG(url_adapt_state_ex).

Although this code may be a part of a larger codebase that has potential vulnerabilities, this specific snippet does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, directory traversals, or SQL injection.

However, without more context or the complete source code, it's impossible to provide a definitive assessment of the security of this function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were identified, no recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	char *encoded;
	int encoded_len;
	smart_str val;
	
	if (! BG(url_adapt_state_ex).active) {
