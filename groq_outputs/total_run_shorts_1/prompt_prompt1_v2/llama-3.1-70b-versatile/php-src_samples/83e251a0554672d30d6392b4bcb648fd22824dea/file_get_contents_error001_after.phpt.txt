VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `file_get_contents` function is used to retrieve data from a URL, which is a potential security risk as it allows an attacker to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external servers. In this case, the code is making a request to a publicly accessible URL, but if the URL was dynamically generated based on user input, the vulnerability would become more severe.

Despite the URL in this case being hardcoded, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to scan the internal network or extract information about the internal network structure. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the `file_get_contents` function is able to make requests to any server, not just external ones.

Additionally, if the URL was dynamically generated, an attacker could potentially inject malicious data into the URL to access restricted data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the URL being requested to prevent SSRF: Ensure that any dynamic URL inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent an attacker from manipulating the request.
2. Implement network isolation: Ensure that the server making the request has access only to the necessary network infrastructure to reduce the attack surface.
3. Use a safer function: Consider using a function that allows for more fine-grained control over the request, such as `curl`, which allows for more security and validation options.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
if (getenv("SKIP_SLOW_TESTS")) die("skip slow test");
if (!function_exists("file_get_contents"))
	die ("skip file_get_contents function is not found");
if (getenv("SKIP_ONLINE_TESTS")) die("skip online test");
?>

<?php
	var_dump(file_get_contents("http://checkip.dyndns.com",null,null,8000,1));
