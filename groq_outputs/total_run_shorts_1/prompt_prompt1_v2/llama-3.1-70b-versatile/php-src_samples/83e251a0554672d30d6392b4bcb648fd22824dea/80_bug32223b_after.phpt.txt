VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The die() function in PHP is used in an insecure manner, which can potentially lead to application crashes and unintended behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The die() function is being used with a string argument that contains user-controlled data, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious data. While it appears that $res is a result of the execution of a PLPGSQL command, an attacker may be able to inject malicious data in an attempt to manipulate the server's behavior.

Furthermore, the use of die() can be problematic as it will print the injected data in the error message that is output, potentially leading to information disclosure about the internal state of the server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To make the code more secure, it is recommended to replace die() with a more secure error handling mechanism. Consider using a custom error handling function that logs and provides a generic error message instead of exposing potentially sensitive data.

Instead of:
```php
if (!$res) die('skip PLPGSQL not available');
```
Use:
```php
if (!$res) {
    error_log('PLPGSQL not available');
    // Provide a generic error message to the user
    exit('An error occurred.');
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;");
if (!$res) die('skip PLPGSQL not available');
?>
