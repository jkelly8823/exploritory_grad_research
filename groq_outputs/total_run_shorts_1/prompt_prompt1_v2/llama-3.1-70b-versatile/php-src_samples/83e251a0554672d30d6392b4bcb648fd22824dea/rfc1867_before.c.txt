VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it is possible that the `find_boundary` function returns an error without setting `self->boundary` to a safe value, but the error is not properly checked. However, the real vulnerability lies in the potential for an untrusted boundary value being passed to the function without proper validation, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if not managed properly.

EXPLANATION:
The boundary value is stored in `self->boundary`, but the code snippet does not provide enough context to determine how this value is being validated or set. Without validation or proper handling, an untrusted boundary value being passed to the function poses a serious threat. The `find_boundary` function's error handling also raises concerns, as if an error occurs and the function returns without modifying the `self->boundary` value, it can lead to unexpected behavior.

Additionally, there is an implicit case scenario where the return value of `find_boundary` could potentially lead to a memory corruption or buffer overflow when there is a mismatch between the size of the allocated memory and the data being copied. This is possible because the function may return `0` as an error value without consuming or overwriting the memory, even if an error has occurred.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's recommended to add proper validation and handling of the `self->boundary` value before passing it to the `find_boundary` function. This includes checks for invalid or untrusted values, proper error handling for the `find_boundary` function, and use of safer operations when handling strings and buffers to prevent potential overflows.

Additionally, consider the following recommendations:

- Ensure proper error handling and error reporting in the `find_boundary` function to prevent potential memory corruption.
- Validate the `self->boundary` value before passing it to the `find_boundary` function.
- Use safer string and buffer operations to prevent potential buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int multipart_buffer_headers(multipart_buffer *self, zend_llist *header TSRMLS_DC)
{
	char *line;
	mime_header_entry prev_entry, entry;
	int prev_len, cur_len;

	/* didn't find boundary, abort */
	if (!find_boundary(self, self->boundary TSRMLS_CC)) {
```
