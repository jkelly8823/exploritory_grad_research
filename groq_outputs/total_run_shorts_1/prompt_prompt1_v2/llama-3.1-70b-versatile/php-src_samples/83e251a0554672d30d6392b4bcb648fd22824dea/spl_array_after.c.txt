VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses TSRMLS_DC macro which is deprecated and could be vulnerable to null pointer dereference and potential segmentation faults due to incorrect use of TSRMLS macros. Additionally, there's an integer variable being used for assignment to `inherited`, where a boolean would be a more suitable fit to hold its value of either true or false. Lastly, assigning `parent` directly without validation could allow null or non-class values.

EXPLANATION:
The TSRMLS_DC macro is deprecated in PHP 5.5 and later. Although its usage is not an immediate vulnerability, it can be problematic in certain scenarios. Furthermore, within this snippet we are assuming other error checking is being done even though it's not being shown.

The assignment to `inherited` shows an attempt to track, possibly, if a certain condition has occurred or not. Although in itself is not necessarily a vulnerability, this snippet doesn't reveal the existence or check to see if clone is of class or how clone should occur. Yet directly assigned an int field as only holding 2 outcomes implies that there are just two paths this section of code would take; and given the context (clone), may result from another implementation decision about which code path to execute. This might simply call for changing the variable's type but given there isn't more, this line and its single-value returntype may just indicate opportunity for future improvement and would be classified accordingly (a smell or todo item as opposed to true vulnerability).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove usage of TSRMLS_DC macro if possible since its deprecation. 
- Ensure there is error checking for original values prior to assignment (especially `class_type` as `parent`). Ensure there is a method of validation.
- Replace inherited int variable to a more suitable boolean variable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
/* {{{ spl_array_object_new_ex */
static zend_object_value spl_array_object_new_ex(zend_class_entry *class_type, spl_array_object **obj, zval *orig, int clone_orig TSRMLS_DC)
{
	zend_object_value retval = {0};
	spl_array_object *intern;
	zval *tmp;
	zend_class_entry * parent = class_type;
	int inherited = 0;
