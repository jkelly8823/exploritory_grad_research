VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure termination of the script, potentially allowing an attacker to see sensitive information, such as file paths or error messages.

EXPLANATION:
The 'die' statement in PHP simply terminates the script and outputs the message provided as an argument. In the context of the given snippet, this message is an error message that can potentially reveal information to an attacker. Although the message itself appears harmless, revealing any information about the internal state of the application can provide a foothold to an attacker. Furthermore, this behavior can expose the location of the script on the server, potentially making it vulnerable to local file inclusion attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more secure error handling mechanism: Instead of simply terminating the script and displaying an error message, consider using a more secure approach such as logging the error and displaying a generic error message to the user.

```php
if (!$res) {
    error_log('PLPGSQL not available');
    header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error');
    exit; // or display a generic error page
}
```

2. Avoid revealing sensitive information: Avoid including sensitive information, such as file paths, in error messages.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
if (!$res) die('skip PLPGSQL not available');
?>
--FILE--
<?php

require_once('config.inc');
```
Note: This evaluation is based solely on the provided code snippet and does not consider potential security mitigations that might be present elsewhere in the application.
