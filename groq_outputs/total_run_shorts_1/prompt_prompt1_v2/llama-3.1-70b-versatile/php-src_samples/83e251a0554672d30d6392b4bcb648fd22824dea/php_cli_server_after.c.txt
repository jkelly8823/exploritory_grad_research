VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No apparent vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to allocate memory using a custom function `safe_pemalloc`. This function is not standard and its implementation is not shown in the code snippet. However, the use of a custom allocation function does not inherently indicate a vulnerability.

The code also includes a check for allocation failure by returning immediately if `buf` is NULL. This is a good practice to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior if the allocation fails.

Overall, this code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities based on the information provided.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	static const char *index_files[] = { "index.php", "index.html", NULL };
	char *buf = safe_pemalloc(1, request->vpath_len, 1 + document_root_len + 1 + sizeof("index.html"), 1);
	char *p = buf, *prev_path = NULL, *q, *vpath;
	size_t prev_path_len = 0;
	int  is_static_file = 0;

	if (!buf) {
		return;
```
