VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Die with User Input reflects a possible information disclosure vulnerability in the code. 
EXPLANATION:
This PHP script uses the die() function to exit the script and display the string 'skip PLPGSQL not available' to the user. While the string itself does not contain any sensitive information, using die() to exit the script with user input can potentially lead to information disclosure. For example, if $res is generated based on user input and an attacker knows the conditions where $res would be false, then they may be able to infer certain details about the application. However, in the given code segment, the likelihood is low and die() only reflects a fixed string in this scenario. 

Regardless of this specific scenario being relatively benign, it is still generally recommended to use exceptions instead of the die() function for handling error conditions because it gives you more control over the output and allows for better error handling and security.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent potential information disclosure and improve error handling, consider replacing die() with exceptions and handling them properly.

```php
try {
    // the code that may cause error
    if (!$res) {
        throw new Exception('PLPGSQL not available');
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // handle the exception and log the error
    error_log($e->getMessage());
    // Instead of die() with error message, just redirect the user
    header('Location: error.php');
    exit;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;");
if (!$res) die('skip PLPGSQL not available');
?>

require_once('config.inc');
