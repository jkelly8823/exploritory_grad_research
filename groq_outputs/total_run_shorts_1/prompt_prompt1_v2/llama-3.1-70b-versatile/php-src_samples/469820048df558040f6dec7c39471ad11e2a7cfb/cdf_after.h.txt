VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet defines a custom data type `cdf_secid_t` as an alias for `int32_t`, and several constants using the `#define` preprocessor directive. There is no user input being processed and no potential for overflows or unauthorized access. The defined constants seem to be used for sentinel values or enumerators. This snippet appears to be a set of definitions and type declarations with no obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
