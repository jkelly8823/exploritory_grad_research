VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uncontrolled comparison operation. This vulnerability could potentially lead to a Buffer Overflow or Information Disclosure.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the uncontrolled comparison operation performed in the `strcmp` function. If the value stored in `path_info` and `orig_path_info` are too large or if they are not null-terminated strings, this could lead to a buffer overflow or an infinite loop, causing a system crash or other unpredictable behavior. Additionally, the use of `strcmp` also introduces a TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-To-Time-Of-Use) vulnerability, where an attacker could potentially modify the values stored in `path_info` and `orig_path_info` between the comparison and subsequent use.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace `strcmp` with a safer string comparison function that checks for `NULL` values and buffer lengths.
   Example: `strncmp(path_info, orig_path_info, MIN(strlen(path_info), strlen(orig_path_info)))`

2. Ensure `path_info` and `orig_path_info` are null-terminated strings with controlled lengths before passing them to the `strcmp` function.

3. Implement input validation for `env_path_info` and `strcmp` to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
								path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;
								tflag = (slen != 0 && (!orig_path_info || strcmp(orig_path_info, path_info) != 0));
							} else {
								path_info = (env_path_info && pilen > slen) ? env_path_info + pilen - slen : NULL;
								tflag = path_info && (orig_path_info != path_info);
							}

							if (tflag) {
								if (orig_path_info) {
