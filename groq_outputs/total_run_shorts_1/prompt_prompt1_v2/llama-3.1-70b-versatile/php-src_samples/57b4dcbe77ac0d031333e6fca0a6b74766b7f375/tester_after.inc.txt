VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is located in the `makeSourceFile()` function which returns a path to a file named 'src.php'. However, this path is stored in a variable and then not used properly. Instead, the variable `$filePath` is returned, which is not even declared in this code snippet. Assuming `$filePath` is being generated from user-input or a mix of user-input and internal data, this could lead to a path traversal vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the `$filePath` variable.

However, since we have incomplete information about how `$filePath` is generated, let's focus on the incomplete merge of user-input into `$params`. The code combines `$headers` and an empty array, and then passes it to a `request_data($params, false)` method. Without knowing the contents of `$headers`, it's hard to pinpoint the exact nature of the vulnerability. However, we can assume it could lead to an information disclosure vulnerability or even a remote code execution vulnerability if `request_data` does not properly validate its input.

Also, it's noticeable that the variable `$connKeepAlive` is being passed as a parameter, but there's no validation if it contains malicious data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To mitigate potential vulnerabilities, it is highly recommended to properly validate the contents of `$filePath` and `$headers` before passing them to `makeSourceFile` and `request_data` methods.
- It is also recommended to check the value of `$connKeepAlive` to ensure it's not used as a malicious input.
- It's always good practice to be explicit with your return types to prevent potential errors or vulnerabilities.
- A final recommendation is to provide more input validation and sanitization to prevent an attacker from being able to use these methods maliciously.

ORIGINAL CODE:

            return new Response(null, true);
        }
        if (is_null($uri)) {
            $uri = $this->makeSourceFile();
        }

        $params = array_merge(
            [
            ],
            $headers
        );
        try {
            $this->response = new Response(
                $this->getClient($address, $connKeepAlive)->request_data($params, false)
            );
        return $filePath;
    }

    public function makeSourceFile()
    {
        return $this->makeFile('src.php', $this->code);
