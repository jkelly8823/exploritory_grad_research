VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet includes header files for Windows and defines a macro O_RDONLY. However, I did not detect any security vulnerabilities or potential issues with this snippet. The '#ifdef' directive is properly used to ensure the code is platform-specific. This snippet appears to be properly sanitized and does not contain any known security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
#include <errno.h>

/*
 * Windows TCP can use recvmsg(). Unfortunately, there is no simple way
 * to tell it to return immediately; therefore the interface must
 * use the select() function to ensure that the descriptor is ready for
 * reading.
 */
#ifdef PHP_WIN32
# include <Ws2tcpip.h>
# include "win32/inet.h"
# define O_RDONLY _O_RDONLY
