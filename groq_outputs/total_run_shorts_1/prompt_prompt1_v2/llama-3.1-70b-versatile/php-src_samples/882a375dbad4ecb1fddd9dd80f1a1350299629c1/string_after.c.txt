VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use After Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The line `str_efree(Z_STRVAL_P(result));` suggests that the memory allocated to `result` is being deallocated. However, in the next two lines, this deallocated memory is being used and its length is being accessed. This behavior is indicative of a use-after-free vulnerability. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that you are not using the memory after it has been deallocated. If you need to use the memory afterwards, consider not freeing it until you're done using it. Alternatively, you can also re-allocate the memory after it has been freed if you need to use it again. In this case, since the value of `result` is being overwritten with `temp_result` immediately after the free, the correct approach would be to remove the `str_efree` call. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
			replace_value, replace_len, &Z_STRLEN(temp_result), case_sensitivity, replace_count);
		}

		str_efree(Z_STRVAL_P(result));
		Z_STRVAL_P(result) = Z_STRVAL(temp_result);
		Z_STRLEN_P(result) = Z_STRLEN(temp_result);

		if (Z_STRLEN_P(result) == 0) {
