VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Use of Uninitialised Variable 'sxe' 

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to use a variable named 'sxe' on line 6, but its declaration is not present within this snippet. It may be the case that 'sxe' is not initialized before its use. If 'sxe' is used without being initialized, it may lead to undefined behavior and can potentially introduce vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or information leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that 'sxe' is properly declared and initialized before its use in line 6.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int              namelen;
int              test;
char 		 use_iter;
zval            *iter_data;

use_iter = 0;

sxe = php_sxe_fetch_object(object TSRMLS_CC);
