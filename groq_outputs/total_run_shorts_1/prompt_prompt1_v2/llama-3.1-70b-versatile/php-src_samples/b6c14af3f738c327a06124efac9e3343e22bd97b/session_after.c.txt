VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
Based on the provided code snippet, it appears to be initializing several variables for cryptographic contexts (MD5 and SHA1). There are no apparent indications of a vulnerability. The code initializes variables and uses conditional compilation directives to include or exclude a line based on the availability of certain system facilities (`HAVE_HASH_EXT` and `COMPILE_DL_HASH`). However, no immediate vulnerabilities were identified.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
    PHP_MD5_CTX md5_context;
    PHP_SHA1_CTX sha1_context;
#if defined(HAVE_HASH_EXT) && !defined(COMPILE_DL_HASH)
	void *hash_context = NULL;
#endif
	unsigned char *digest;
	int digest_len;
	int j;
