VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No obvious vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be using preprocessor directives to conditionally include code based on platform-specific configurations. It seems to be using DTRACE and OS-specific functionality. Upon analyzing the code, there are no clear vulnerabilities present in this snippet. 
The SAFE_FILENAME macro suggests that the code is attempting to sanitize file paths and URIs, which is a good security practice. The DTRACE macros also appear to be used for logging and tracing, which does not seem to pose any risks based on this short snippet.

However, it is essential to consider that, without access to the larger codebase, there may be potential issues that arise due to interactions with this snippet that we cannot see.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It's always good practice to validate and sanitize input data, especially when it comes to paths and URI. Since this snippet appears to already take some security considerations into account, no additional code changes are recommended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	int retval = SUCCESS;

#ifdef HAVE_DTRACE
	DTRACE_REQUEST_STARTUP(SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).path_translated), SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_uri), (char *)SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_method));
#endif /* HAVE_DTRACE */

#ifdef PHP_WIN32
	PG(com_initialized) = 0;
#endif

#ifdef HAVE_DTRACE
	DTRACE_REQUEST_SHUTDOWN(SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).path_translated), SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_uri), (char *)SAFE_FILENAME(SG(request_info).request_method));
#endif /* HAVE_DTRACE */
