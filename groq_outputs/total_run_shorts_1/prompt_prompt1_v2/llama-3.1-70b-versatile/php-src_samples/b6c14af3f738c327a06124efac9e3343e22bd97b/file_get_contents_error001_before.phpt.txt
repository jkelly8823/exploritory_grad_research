VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code has a vulnerability due to its use of the `file_get_contents` function to fetch remote resources without proper input validation or sanitization.

EXPLANATION:
The `file_get_contents` function is used to fetch the contents of a remote URL. However, this function can be used to launch SSRF attacks (Server-Side Request Forgery) if the URL is not properly sanitized. The code does not check the contents of the URL before making a request, which allows an attacker to potentially access internal resources or services that are not intended to be exposed.

In this case, the URL `http://checkip.dyndns.com` appears to be legitimate, but an attacker could potentially manipulate this URL to point to a different resource, potentially exploiting internal services.

Additionally, the use of `die` to exit the program when the `file_get_contents` function is not found is also vulnerable to injection attacks. An attacker could potentially manipulate the error message to inject malicious code or information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the URL before making a request using `file_get_contents`.
- Use curl library instead of file_get_contents for making HTTP requests to get better control over headers, connection timeouts, etc.
- Implement error handling instead of using `die` to avoid injection attacks.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive resources.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
	if (getenv("SKIP_SLOW_TESTS")) die("skip slow test");
	if (!function_exists("file_get_contents"))
		die ("skip file_get_contents function is not found");
?>
--FILE--
<?php
	var_dump(file_get_contents("http://checkip.dyndns.com",null,null,8000,1));
```
