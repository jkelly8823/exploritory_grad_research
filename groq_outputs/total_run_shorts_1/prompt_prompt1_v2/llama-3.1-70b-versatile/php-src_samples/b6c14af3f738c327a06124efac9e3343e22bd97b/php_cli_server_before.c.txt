VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential NULL pointer dereference and memory leak.

EXPLANATION: 
The function `safe_pemalloc` is used to allocate memory for the `buf` pointer. However, if `safe_pemalloc` fails and returns `NULL`, the function does not clean up or deallocate any previously allocated memory (`request->vpath_len`, `document_root_len`), which can lead to memory leaks. Furthermore, if `safe_pemalloc` returns `NULL` and is not checked properly, it can cause a NULL pointer dereference when trying to access or use the `buf` pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should be modified to handle memory allocation failures properly. It is recommended to add error checking code after the allocation function call to ensure that `buf` is not NULL before using it. Additionally, when `safe_pemalloc` returns `NULL`, any previously allocated memory should be freed or deallocated to prevent memory leaks. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

	static const char *index_files[] = { "index.php", "index.html", NULL };
	char *buf = safe_pemalloc(1, request->vpath_len, 1 + document_root_len + 1 + sizeof("index.html"), 1);
	char *p = buf, *prev_path = NULL, *q, *vpath;
	size_t prev_path_len;
	int  is_static_file = 0;

	if (!buf) {
		return;
