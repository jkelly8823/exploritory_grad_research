VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Information Disclosure through Inconsistent Error Handling.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the inconsistent error handling within the switch statement. For the `ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES_FUNC_ID` case, no value is assigned to `val` or no action is taken. However, the `PSCI_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED` value is assigned to `val` at the beginning of the code snippet and only updated for the `ARM_SMCCC_VERSION_FUNC_ID` case. This means that when `ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES_FUNC_ID` is encountered, the function will return `PSCI_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED` even if it doesn't apply to this specific function ID. This can potentially disclose information to an attacker about which features are not supported by the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should handle the `ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES_FUNC_ID` case consistently. This could involve assigning a valid value to `val` or returning an error code specifically indicating that this feature is not supported. For example:
```c
case ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES_FUNC_ID:
	val = ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES_NOT_SUPPORTED;
	break;
```
Alternatively, the function could return a more generic error value indicating that this function ID is not supported, but only after properly handling any necessary logic or cleanup.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
	u32 func_id = smccc_get_function(vcpu);
	u32 val = PSCI_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED;

	switch (func_id) {
	case ARM_SMCCC_VERSION_FUNC_ID:
		val = ARM_SMCCC_VERSION_1_1;
		break;
	case ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES_FUNC_ID:
		/* Nothing supported yet */
		break;
	default:
		return kvm_psci_call(vcpu);
	}
```
