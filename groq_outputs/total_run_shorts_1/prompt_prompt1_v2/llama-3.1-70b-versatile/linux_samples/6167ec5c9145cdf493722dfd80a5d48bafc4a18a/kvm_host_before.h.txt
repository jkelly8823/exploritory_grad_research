VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to restore the DAIF (Data Access and Instruction Fetch) flags for the process context in an ARM64 system, after potential interrupts have been disabled. The function local_daif_restore is not defined in this snippet, which might raise concerns. However, in this context, and given our goal of detecting vulnerabilities within this specific snippet, the lack of the function definition does not introduce a vulnerability.

The __ARM64_KVM_HOST_H__ preprocessor directive checking for the existence of a specific header file suggests that this code is part of a KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) host implementation for the ARM64 architecture.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
{
	local_daif_restore(DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ);
}
