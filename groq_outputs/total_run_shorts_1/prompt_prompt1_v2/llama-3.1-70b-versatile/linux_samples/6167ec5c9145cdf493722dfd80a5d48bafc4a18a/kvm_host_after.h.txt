VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
I analyzed the provided code snippet and did not identify any potential vulnerabilities. The code appears to be part of a KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) host implementation for ARM64 architecture, but there are no obvious security issues present in this snippet.

The first block of code simply calls a function named `local_daif_restore` with a specific flag, while the second block of code defines an inline function named `kvm_arm_harden_branch_predictor`. This function checks if a specific CPU capability is present. None of these operations appear to be vulnerable to common security threats such as buffer overflows, data leaks, or unauthorized access.

It is essential to note that without the complete context and definitions of the functions and variables used in this snippet, further analysis may be required to ensure the overall security of the program. However, based on the information provided, no specific vulnerabilities were found.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
	local_daif_restore(DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ);
}

static inline bool kvm_arm_harden_branch_predictor(void)
{
	return cpus_have_const_cap(ARM64_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR);
}

#endif /* __ARM64_KVM_HOST_H__ */
