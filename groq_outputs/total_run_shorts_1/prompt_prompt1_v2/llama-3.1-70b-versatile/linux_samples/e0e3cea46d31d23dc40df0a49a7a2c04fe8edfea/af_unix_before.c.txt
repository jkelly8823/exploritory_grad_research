VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability, duplicated code, and usage of a global variable (&tmp_scm) that can lead to race conditions and shared resource issues.

EXPLANATION:
The code seems to be handling socket communication with a Unix domain socket. However, there are two instances of nearly identical code. The variable `tmp_scm` is not defined in the provided code snippet but assuming it's a global variable or a static array shared between functions, it can lead to shared resource issues and race conditions in multi-threaded or concurrent environments. If `tmp_scm` is modified while being used by another thread or function, unpredictable behavior can occur. 

Even without multi-threading issues, the check and assignment of `siocb->scm` may not serve the intended purpose as it might still be NULL after assignment, especially if `wait_for_unix_gc()` has its own internal delays or fails.

The duplicated code is less efficient, takes up more space and, if modified in only one location, introduces a possibility of inconsistent behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Avoid using shared resources (`tmp_scm`), make the variables local or exclusive per thread/function. Move the duplicated code into its own function or eliminate the duplicate altogether. Incorporate thread-safe coding practices if multiple threads are involved.

Consider rewriting to avoid TOCTOU and adding additional error handling when waiting for `unix_gc`:

```c
if (NULL == siocb->scm){
    siocb->scm = scm_allocate(); // instead of sharing a static resource
    if (NULL == siocb->scm) return -ENOMEM;
}
scm_lock(); // locking mechanism if applicable
wait_for_unix_gc();
err = scm_send(sock, msg, siocb->scm);
scm_unlock(); // if locked previously
if (err < 0){
    scm_free(siocb->scm);
    return err;
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (NULL == siocb->scm)
    siocb->scm = &tmp_scm;
wait_for_unix_gc();
err = scm_send(sock, msg, siocb->scm);
if (err < 0)
    return err;

err = -EOPNOTSUPP;
if (NULL == siocb->scm)
    siocb->scm = &tmp_scm;
wait_for_unix_gc();
err = scm_send(sock, msg, siocb->scm);
if (err < 0)
    return err;

err = -EOPNOTSUPP;
```
