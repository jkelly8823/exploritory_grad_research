VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No significant vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code appears to be involved in message passing, using the `scm_send` function. However, there are duplicate blocks of code in the provided snippet, which is inefficient and potentially an indication of copy-paste errors. Nevertheless, after code review, no critical vulnerabilities have been detected in this code. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No changes are recommended to address potential security vulnerabilities in this code. However, to improve overall code quality and readability, it would be beneficial to eliminate duplicate code lines and consolidate the functionality into a single block.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (NULL == siocb->scm)
	siocb->scm = &tmp_scm;
wait_for_unix_gc();
err = scm_send(sock, msg, siocb->scm, false);
if (err < 0)
	return err;

err = -EOPNOTSUPP;
if (NULL == siocb->scm)
	siocb->scm = &tmp_scm;
wait_for_unix_gc();
err = scm_send(sock, msg, siocb->scm, false);
if (err < 0)
	return err;
