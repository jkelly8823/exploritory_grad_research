VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Clearing sensitive data with memset() in a multi-threaded environment does not guarantee the memory will be cleared before other threads access it.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, memset() is used to clear the contents of the scm struct. However, in a multi-threaded environment, using memset() to clear sensitive data is not thread-safe. The memset() function does not guarantee that the memory will be cleared before another thread accesses it, which can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using memset() to clear sensitive data in a multi-threaded environment. 
2. Instead, consider using a more secure method to clear sensitive data, such as explicit writes to the affected memory locations. 
3. Additionally, consider using OpenBSD's explicit_bzero() or a comparable function, which is designed to be more secure for clearing sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
}
static __inline__ int scm_send(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg,
			       struct scm_cookie *scm)
{
	memset(scm, 0, sizeof(*scm));
	unix_get_peersec_dgram(sock, scm);
	if (msg->msg_controllen <= 0)
		return 0;
	return __scm_send(sock, msg, scm);
}
