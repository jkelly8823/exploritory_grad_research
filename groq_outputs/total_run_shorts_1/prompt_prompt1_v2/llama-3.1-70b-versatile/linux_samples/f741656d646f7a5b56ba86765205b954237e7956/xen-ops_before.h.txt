VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a collection of function declarations in C. The functions seem to be related to Xen hypervisor operations. No potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or any other common security issues were detected. The functions only declare their existence, and no actual code execution or variable manipulation occurs in the snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As no vulnerabilities were detected, there are no recommended fixes. It is always a good practice to keep an eye on function implementations when reviewing code, especially if they are used for critical operations like hypervisor interactions. However, in this specific snippet, no issues were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void xen_vcpu_restore(void);

void xen_callback_vector(void);
void xen_hvm_resume_shared_info(void);
void xen_unplug_emulated_devices(void);

void __init xen_build_dynamic_phys_to_machine(void);
unsigned long __init xen_revector_p2m_tree(void);
