VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be part of a larger function in a kernel module, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It consists of a series of function calls to reset and update various bits and masks. There is no user input or data being processed, and there are no apparent memory allocation or usage issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
There are no recommended fixes for this code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
    update_permission_bitmask(vcpu, context, true);
    update_pkru_bitmask(vcpu, context, true);
    reset_rsvds_bits_mask_ept(vcpu, context, execonly);
    reset_ept_shadow_zero_bits_mask(vcpu, context, execonly);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(kvm_init_shadow_ept_mmu);
```
Note that this code evaluates to "VULNERABLE: NO" simply due to the context of the segment and focus on known vulnerabilities, and not because the assessment evaluated the validity or intent of the function calls themselves.
