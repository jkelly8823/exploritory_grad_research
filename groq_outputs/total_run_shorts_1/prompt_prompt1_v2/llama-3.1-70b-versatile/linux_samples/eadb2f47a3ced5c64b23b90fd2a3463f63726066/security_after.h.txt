VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be an enumeration of constants, specifically lock-down modes. It does not contain any control flow or logical expressions that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. The names of the constants suggest that they are related to Linux kernel security features, but there is no executable code present that could be exploited.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no recommended fixes for this code, as no vulnerabilities were found. However, it is recommended to ensure that these constants are used securely in other parts of the codebase.
