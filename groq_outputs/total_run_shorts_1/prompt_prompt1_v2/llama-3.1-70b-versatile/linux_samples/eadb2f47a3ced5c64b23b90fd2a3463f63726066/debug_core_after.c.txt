VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses a "goto" like statement by using the `continue` statement to jump over a `break` statement in some cases. However, this isn't the potential vulnerability I'm focusing on. In this case, a potential vulnerability exists in this code due to the use of `break` statement, but a method above that concerns me the most - The potential issue is with serial stub code being called if lockdown is not applied in certain configurations.

EXPLANATION:
The gdb_serial_stub function is called regardless of lockdown status being applied, even though the lockdown being applied at kernel runtime would be a better check here. If lockdown isn't applied at a higher layer, this will still call the gdb_serial_stub function without first checking the kernel runtime lockdown status. Then you might get unexpected behavior calling into this function, potentially jumping to user-controlled code with elevated or higher privileges depending on the code. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
A more secure way to handle this would be to check kernel runtime lockdown status before calling into gdb_serial_stub. 

```c
if (security_locked_down(LOCKDOWN_DBG_WRITE_KERNEL)) {
    break;
} else {
    error = gdb_serial_stub(ks);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/vmacache.h>
#include <linux/rcupdate.h>
#include <linux/irq.h>
#include <linux/security.h>

#include <asm/cacheflush.h>
#include <asm/byteorder.h>
#include <linux/atomic.h>
                continue;
            kgdb_connected = 0;
        } else {
            /*
             * This is a brutal way to interfere with the debugger
             * and prevent gdb being used to poke at kernel memory.
             * This could cause trouble if lockdown is applied when
             * there is already an active gdb session. For now the
             * answer is simply "don't do that". Typically lockdown
             * *will* be applied before the debug core gets started
             * so only developers using kgdb for fairly advanced
             * early kernel debug can be biten by this. Hopefully
             * they are sophisticated enough to take care of
             * themselves, especially with help from the lockdown
             * message printed on the console!
