VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential information leak through unsanitized input
EXPLANATION:
The code appears to handle VMExit events generated by a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). Specifically, it checks the condition for a page fault or a no-device interrupt, and then queries the exception bitmap for a given interrupt vector. The vulnerability lies in the usage of the 'intr_info' variable without proper validation. The 'intr_info' variable is used to retrieve the exception bitmap, but there is no check to ensure that 'intr_info' is within a valid range. This may allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the exceptions bitmap by manipulating the 'intr_info' variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add bounds checking to ensure that 'intr_info' is within a valid range before using it to query the exception bitmap. Additionally, consider sanitizing the 'intr_info' input to prevent potential information leaks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
else if (is_page_fault(intr_info))
	return enable_ept;
else if (is_no_device(intr_info) &&
	 !(nested_read_cr0(vmcs12) & X86_CR0_TS))
	return 0;
return vmcs12->exception_bitmap &
		(1u << (intr_info & INTR_INFO_VECTOR_MASK));
case EXIT_REASON_EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT:
```

Example of sanitized code:
```c
uint32_t intr_info_mask = intr_info & INTR_INFO_VECTOR_MASK;
if (intr_info_mask < MAX_INTR_INFO_VECTOR) {
	return vmcs12->exception_bitmap &
			(1u << intr_info_mask);
} else {
	// Handle invalid intr_info value
	// For example, log an error and return an error value
}
```
In this sanitized code, we first extract the interrupt vector from 'intr_info' and then check if it's within a valid range. This ensures that the index used to query the exception bitmap is valid and prevents potential information leaks.
