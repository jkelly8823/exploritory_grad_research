VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `follow_trans_huge_pmd` function returns a `struct page *` pointer to a page that may be modified after the function returns, potentially leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
In the `follow_trans_huge_pmd` function, the code calculates the page offset based on the address and stores it in the `page` variable. The problem arises from the fact that the `page` variable is a pointer to a page that may be modified or unmapped by other threads after this function returns. This is a common issue in kernel code, where page tables are constantly being modified.
However, I identified a potential issue with the page offset calculation when the called function does not ensure that the returned `page` pointer remains valid. Specifically, I point out the line in the function that shifts the `addr` down by `PAGE_SHIFT` and uses this to offset the page, but doesn't ensure this still refers to the correct page when the functions returns.
This could potentially lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities if the returned page is used after it has been unmapped or modified by another thread.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the `follow_trans_huge_pmd` function should ensure that the returned `page` pointer remains valid and that the page is not modified or unmapped by other threads until it is safe to do so. One way to achieve this is by using `get_page_unless_zero` to get a reference to the page before returning it. If the `page` is no longer valid after getting a reference to it, you should safely handle the failure case.
Additionally, consider using a synchronization mechanism such as spinlocks or semaphores to ensure that the returned page is not modified or unmapped until it is safe to do so.
