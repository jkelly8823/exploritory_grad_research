VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a collection of function pointer declarations for a kernel virtual machine (KVM) implementation. The functions seem to be related to virtual CPU operations, including setting CPUID entries, writing TSC offsets, and getting exit information. However, none of these functions appear to directly interact with user-input data or perform any operations that could introduce a vulnerability. Without additional context or information about how these functions are implemented or used, no potential vulnerabilities were identified.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	int (*get_lpage_level)(void);
	bool (*rdtscp_supported)(void);
	bool (*invpcid_supported)(void);

	void (*set_tdp_cr3)(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, unsigned long cr3);

	void (*set_supported_cpuid)(u32 func, struct kvm_cpuid_entry2 *entry);

	void (*write_tsc_offset)(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, u64 offset);

	void (*get_exit_info)(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, u64 *info1, u64 *info2);

	int (*check_intercept)(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,
			       struct x86_instruction_info *info,
