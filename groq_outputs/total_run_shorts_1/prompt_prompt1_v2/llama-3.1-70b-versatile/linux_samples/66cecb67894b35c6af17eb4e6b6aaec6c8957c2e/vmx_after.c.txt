VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 154-155, 169-170
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains vulnerable conditions in the form of bounds-checking failure in two different locations.

EXPLANATION:
In the function nested_vmx_failValid(vcpu, VMXERR_INVALID_OPERAND_TO_INVEPT_INVVPID), there are two pieces of code that do not properly check the bounds of 'type'. 

In the first instance (lines 154-155), the code checks if 'type' is less than 32 and if the bitwise AND operation of 'type' with 'types' results in a non-zero value. However, if 'type' is 32 or greater, the function will not check the bitwise AND operation with 'types'. This could potentially lead to a bounds-checking failure.

Similarly, in the second instance (lines 169-170), the code performs the same check on 'type', but it does not properly handle the case where 'type' is 32 or greater.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent bounds-checking failure, the code should properly check the bounds of 'type' in both instances. This can be achieved by adding additional checks to ensure 'type' is within the valid range.

For instance, in the first occurrence:

```c
if (type < 0 || type >= 32 || !(types & (1 << type))) {
	nested_vmx_failValid(vcpu, VMXERR_INVALID_OPERAND_TO_INVEPT_INVVPID);
	skip_emulated_instruction(vcpu);
	return 1;
}
```

And in the second occurrence:

```c
if (type < 0 || type >= 32 || !(types & (1 << type))) {
	nested_vmx_failValid(vcpu, VMXERR_INVALID_OPERAND_TO_INVEPT_INVVPID);
	skip_emulated_instruction(vcpu);
	return 1;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

This response contains a truncated version of the code for brevity.

```c
types = (vmx->nested.nested_vmx_ept_caps >> VMX_EPT_EXTENT_SHIFT) & 6;

if (type >= 32 || !(types & (1 << type))) {
	nested_vmx_failValid(vcpu,
			VMXERR_INVALID_OPERAND_TO_INVEPT_INVVPID);
	skip_emulated_instruction(vcpu);
	return 1;

types = (vmx->nested.nested_vmx_vpid_caps >> 8) & 0x7;

if (type >= 32 || !(types & (1 << type))) {
	nested_vmx_failValid(vcpu,
		VMXERR_INVALID_OPERAND_TO_INVEPT_INVVPID);
	skip_emulated_instruction(vcpu);
	return 1;
```
