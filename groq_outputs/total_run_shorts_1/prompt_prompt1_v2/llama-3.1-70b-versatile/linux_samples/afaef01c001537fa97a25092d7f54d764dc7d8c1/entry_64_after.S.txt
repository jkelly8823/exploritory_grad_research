VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a low-level assembly code snippet, likely from a Linux kernel or similar low-level system programming context. After careful analysis, I have determined that this code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, unchecked input, or uninitialized variables. The code snippet seems to be managing stack state and switching to a user-space stack frame, but it does not appear to have any security-sensitive issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it appears to be correctly implemented.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
    * We are on the trampoline stack.  All regs except RDI are live.
    * We can do future final exit work right here.
    */
    STACKLEAK_ERASE_NOCLOBBER

    SWITCH_TO_USER_CR3_STACK scratch_reg=%rdi

    popq    %rdi
    popq    %rsp
    * We are on the trampoline stack.  All regs except RDI are live.
    * We can do future final exit work right here.
    */
    STACKLEAK_ERASE_NOCLOBBER

    SWITCH_TO_USER_CR3_STACK scratch_reg=%rdi

    /* Restore RDI. */
