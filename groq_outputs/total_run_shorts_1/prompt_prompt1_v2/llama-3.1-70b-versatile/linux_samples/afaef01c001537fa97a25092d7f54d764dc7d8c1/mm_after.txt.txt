VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a description of a kernel's virtual memory map and some architectural details about 64-bit virtual addresses. It does not contain any executable code that can be vulnerability-prone. There is no evident misuse of functions, methods, or operators that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
[fixmap start]   - ffffffffff5fffff kernel-internal fixmap range
ffffffffff600000 - ffffffffff600fff (=4 kB) legacy vsyscall ABI
ffffffffffe00000 - ffffffffffffffff (=2 MB) unused hole
STACKLEAK_POISON value in this last hole: ffffffffffff4111

Virtual memory map with 5 level page tables:

0000000000000000 - 00ffffffffffffff (=56 bits) user space, different per mm
[fixmap start]   - ffffffffff5fffff kernel-internal fixmap range
ffffffffff600000 - ffffffffff600fff (=4 kB) legacy vsyscall ABI
ffffffffffe00000 - ffffffffffffffff (=2 MB) unused hole
STACKLEAK_POISON value in this last hole: ffffffffffff4111

Architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address. Implementations can support
less. Currently supported are 48- and 57-bit virtual addresses. Bits 63
through to the most-significant implemented bit are sign extended.
