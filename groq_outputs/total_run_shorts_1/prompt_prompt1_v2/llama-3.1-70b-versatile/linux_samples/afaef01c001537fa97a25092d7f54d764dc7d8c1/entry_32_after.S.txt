VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential Spectre Variant 2 vulnerability due to use of indirect calls without mitigation, and a call instruction without zeroing the RPB (Return Prediction Barrier).

EXPLANATION:
The function uses `call` instructions without properly mitigating the Spectre Variant 2 vulnerability. Specifically, the calls to `syscall_return_slowpath` and `do_int80_syscall_32` are indirect calls that can be exploited by an attacker. Furthermore, the `call` instruction is used without zeroing the RPB, which can be exploited by an attacker who controls the branch predictor.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the code can be modified to use the `retpoline` thunk to mitigate indirect calls, or `lp` instructions to zero the RPB before the call. The recommendation is to replace the calls to `syscall_return_slowpath` and `do_int80_syscall_32` with retpoline or lp instructions.
