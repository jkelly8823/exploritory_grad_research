VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a comment or documentation block describing a virtual memory map and addressing scheme for a 64-bit system. It does not contain any executable code, and therefore, no vulnerabilities were detected.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
[fixmap start]   - ffffffffff5fffff kernel-internal fixmap range
ffffffffff600000 - ffffffffff600fff (=4 kB) legacy vsyscall ABI
ffffffffffe00000 - ffffffffffffffff (=2 MB) unused hole

Virtual memory map with 5 level page tables:

0000000000000000 - 00ffffffffffffff (=56 bits) user space, different per mm
[fixmap start]   - ffffffffff5fffff kernel-internal fixmap range
ffffffffff600000 - ffffffffff600fff (=4 kB) legacy vsyscall ABI
ffffffffffe00000 - ffffffffffffffff (=2 MB) unused hole

Architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address. Implementations can support
less. Currently supported are 48- and 57-bit virtual addresses. Bits 63
through to the most-significant implemented bit are sign extended.
