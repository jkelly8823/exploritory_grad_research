VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be defining some extern variables and constants for different modes of page table. The variables are declared as `__read_mostly`, indicating that they are mostly read and occasionally written. The constants `PT_MODE_SYSTEM` and `PT_MODE_HOST_GUEST` are numerical values that represent different modes of page table.

There is no evidence of potential misuse of these variables or constants that could potentially introduce a vulnerability. The variables are merely being declared and are not being used in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern bool __read_mostly enable_unrestricted_guest;
extern bool __read_mostly enable_ept_ad_bits;
extern bool __read_mostly enable_pml;
extern bool __read_mostly enable_apicv;
extern int __read_mostly pt_mode;

#define PT_MODE_SYSTEM        0
#define PT_MODE_HOST_GUEST    1
