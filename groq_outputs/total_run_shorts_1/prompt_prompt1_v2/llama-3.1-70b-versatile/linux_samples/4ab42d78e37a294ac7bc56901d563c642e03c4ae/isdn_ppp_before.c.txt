VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource management issue with potential use-after-free vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet has a potential vulnerability due to incorrect handling of the `slcomp` resource. The `slhc_init` function is used to allocate a new compression context for PPP packets. However, if this allocation fails, the `sltmp` is NULL, and no free operation is performed on the existing `is->slcomp` resource. This can lead to a use-after-free scenario if the existing `is->slcomp` resource is freed later in the code.

Additionally, when the `sltmp` allocation is successful, the existing `is->slcomp` resource is freed using `slhc_free` before being reassigned to `sltmp`. This looks like a safe operation, but it can still lead to a potential double-free issue if the `sltmp` allocation fails and the error path is not correctly handled.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should correctly handle the `slcomp` resource by freeing the existing resource only after the new allocation has been successfully completed. Also, the code should check for NULL before freeing the existing resource to prevent double-free issues. Here is an example of how to fix this:

```c
sltmp = slhc_init(16, val);
if (!sltmp) {
    printk(KERN_ERR "ippp, can't realloc slhc struct\n");
    return -ENOMEM;
}
if (is->slcomp) {
    slhc_free(is->slcomp);
}
is->slcomp = sltmp;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
 * VJ header compression init
 */
	is->slcomp = slhc_init(16, 16);	/* not necessary for 2. link in bundle */
	if (!is->slcomp) {
		isdn_ppp_ccp_reset_free(is);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_IPPP_FILTER
	is->pass_filter = NULL;
			is->maxcid = val;
#ifdef CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_VJ
			sltmp = slhc_init(16, val);
			if (!sltmp) {
				printk(KERN_ERR "ippp, can't realloc slhc struct\n");
				return -ENOMEM;
			}
			if (is->slcomp)
				slhc_free(is->slcomp);
			is->slcomp = sltmp;
#endif
```
