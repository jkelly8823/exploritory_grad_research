VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to define a set of constants for CPU flags, likely for the x86 architecture. The code defines a set of flags related to CR4 (Control Register 4) and CR8 (Control Register 8) using bitwise OR operations. The snippet also defines a constant `CR8_RESERVED_BITS` by inverting the bits of `X86_CR8_TPR`. This code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or unchecked input handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
