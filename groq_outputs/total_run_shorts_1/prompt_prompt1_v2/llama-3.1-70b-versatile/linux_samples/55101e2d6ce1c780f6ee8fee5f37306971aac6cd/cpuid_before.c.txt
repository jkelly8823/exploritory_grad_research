VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unsynchronized access to shared resource.

EXPLANATION:
The `get_cpu()` function call is used to acquire the CPU, but it is not clear how it ensures that only one CPU can access the code path within it. Since the comment above explicitly states that "all calls to `cpuid_count()` should be made on the same cpu", it implies that there is a shared resource access. However, it does not show any synchronization mechanism to prevent concurrent access by multiple CPUs.

Since this code snippet is supposed to prevent access to a shared resource (`cpuid_count()`) from multiple CPUs, the potential vulnerability is due to missing or inadequate synchronization. This could lead to data corruption or incorrect results if multiple CPUs try to access the shared resource simultaneously.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add synchronization primitives, such as locks or semaphores, to ensure that only one CPU can access the shared resource at a time. This will ensure that the `cpuid_count()` function is executed atomically, preventing potential data corruption or incorrect results.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
const u32 kvm_supported_word9_x86_features =
	F(FSGSBASE) | F(BMI1) | F(HLE) | F(AVX2) | F(SMEP) |
	F(BMI2) | F(ERMS) | f_invpcid | F(RTM) | f_mpx | F(RDSEED) |
	F(ADX);

/* all calls to cpuid_count() should be made on the same cpu */
get_cpu();
```
