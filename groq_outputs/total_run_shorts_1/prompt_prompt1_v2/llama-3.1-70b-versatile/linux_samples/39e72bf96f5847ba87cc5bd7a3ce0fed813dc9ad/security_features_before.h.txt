VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to contain preprocessor directives defining constants for specific software features. The use of these constants, SEC_FTR_FLUSH_COUNT_CACHE and SEC_FTR_DEFAULT, is not inherently vulnerable. The values assigned to these constants seem to be correctly defined, and no user input is processed in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None required.
ORIGINAL CODE:
// Software required to flush count cache on context switch

// Features enabled by default
#define SEC_FTR_DEFAULT \
	(SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_HV | \
