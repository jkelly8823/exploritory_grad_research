VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a collection of extern variable declarations, which are used to declare variables that are defined elsewhere in the program. These declarations themselves do not contain any potentially vulnerable code. The variables are declared as extern, indicating they are defined elsewhere in the program, so their usage cannot be evaluated within this snippet. However, their declarations do not appear to be vulnerable to any known exploits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
