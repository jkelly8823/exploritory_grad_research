VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow and Potential Crash Due to Unhandled Error Return.

EXPLANATION:
The function is vulnerable to integer overflow when calculating the total size of the pointers (ptr_size) and adding it to the current size. This is because the sum of ptr_size and size might exceed ULONG_MAX, causing an integer overflow when this sum is evaluated again in the line 'if (size > READ_ONCE(rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur) / 4)'. However, this specific issue is already being checked with the line 'if (ptr_size > ULONG_MAX - size)'. Thus, the main vulnerability arises in the event that the subsequent check 'if (size > READ_ONCE(rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur) / 4)' fails. If this check fails and 'goto fail' is executed, then 'put_page(page)' is called. However, this leaves the current function to return a value of NULL to its caller without any other indication of failure. The caller may not check for this return value, leading to potential crashes or errors in handling. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
First, consider whether there are other places in the code where the page could be in use when put_page() is called, and ensure that any shared resources are cleanly released to prevent memory or resource leaks.

Add proper error handling and propagate the potential failure through the call stack. 

In addition to returning NULL to indicate failure, also print an error message (if relevant) or set an error flag (if supported by the context) so that it can be reported to the user or caught by higher-level code. This error flag or messages will help the program to take recovery actions before continuing execution.
