VULNERABLE_LINES: error_decode, error_no_cert
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability, Resource Leak, and Incorrect Error Handling

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals potential issues with resource management and error handling. In the 'error_decode' label, memory is freed for 'cert->pub->key' and 'ctx', but no check is performed to ensure that these pointers are not null or already freed. Additionally, the 'x509_free_certificate(cert)' call in the 'error_no_cert' label does not check if 'cert' is null. This could lead to use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities, potentially causing program crashes or exploiting attacks. Furthermore, the error handling mechanism appears to be incorrect, as it attempts to free resources after an error has occurred, but does not properly handle the cleanup of all allocated memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add null checks before freeing memory for 'cert->pub->key', 'ctx', and 'cert'.
2. Ensure that all allocated memory is properly freed in case of an error, to prevent resource leaks.
3. Consider using more robust error handling mechanisms, such as exception handling or proper cleanup functions, to prevent potential use-after-free vulnerabilities.
4. Implement double-free protection, e.g., by setting the pointer to null after it's freed.

error_decode:
	kfree(cert->pub->key);
	kfree(ctx);
