VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has potential memory leaks due to incomplete kfree calls in error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses kmalloc to allocate memory for the struct hash_mm_context and struct subpage_prot_table. However, in the error handling path, the programmer only calls kfree on the struct hash_mm_context object when memory allocation for struct subpage_prot_table fails. If both allocations are successful and an error occurs later, the memory allocated for struct subpage_prot_table is not freed. 

Additionally, even though it is not shown in the given snippet, potential null pointer dereferences might occur when manipulating mm->context.hash_context->spt, mm->context.hash_context if their allocations fail.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
When mm->context.hash_context allocation fails, it's recommended to add an error path in case index is a valid value and handle index after failing allocations:
   Consider catching every potential allocation failure case, and adding the kfree() that needs to handle all failed allocations. Always pair allocations and deallocations to avoid further potential problems.

However, you can avoid this complexity issue by letting a higher-level exception handling function or mechanism deal with such failures. To ensure further readability, make sure you understand exception handling principles before applying a way of dealing with potential exceptions. 

Lastly, put emphasis on clean code by preferring to not use a more error-prone nested function calls. Please consider a more simplified representation of your potential errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void slb_setup_new_exec(void);

static int hash__init_new_context(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	int index;

	index = hash__alloc_context_id();
	if (index < 0)
		return index;

	mm->context.hash_context = kmalloc(sizeof(struct hash_mm_context),
					   GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!mm->context.hash_context) {
		ida_free(&mmu_context_ida, index);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}

	/*
	 * The old code would re-promote on fork, we don't do that when using
	 * slices as it could cause problem promoting slices that have been
			mm->context.hash_context->spt = kmalloc(sizeof(struct subpage_prot_table),
								GFP_KERNEL);
			if (!mm->context.hash_context->spt) {
				ida_free(&mmu_context_ida, index);
				kfree(mm->context.hash_context);
				return -ENOMEM;
			}
		}
#endif

	}

	pkey_mm_init(mm);
	return index;
