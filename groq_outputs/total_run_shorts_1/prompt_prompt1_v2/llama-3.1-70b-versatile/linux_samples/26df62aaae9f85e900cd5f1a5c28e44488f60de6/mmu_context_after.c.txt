VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential use-after-free vulnerability in hash__init_new_context function
EXPLANATION:
The hash__init_new_context function allocates memory for struct hash_mm_context and its subpage_prot_table. However, in the error handling path, it frees the subpage_prot_table memory but not the hash_mm_context memory, which is still referenced by mm->context.hash_context. This can lead to a use-after-free scenario if realloc_context_ids fails.

Additionally, the function allocates memory for subpage_prot_table conditionally based on the PPC_SUBPAGE_PROT configuration, but frees it unconditionally. This can lead to a memory leak if the configuration is not enabled.

Furthermore, the function returns an error code directly from the realloc_context_ids function call without properly handling the memory allocations. This can also lead to memory leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always free the hash_mm_context memory in the error path to prevent use-after-free.
- Free the subpage_prot_table conditionally based on the PPC_SUBPAGE_PROT configuration to prevent memory leaks.
- Handle the memory allocations properly in the error path to prevent memory leaks.
