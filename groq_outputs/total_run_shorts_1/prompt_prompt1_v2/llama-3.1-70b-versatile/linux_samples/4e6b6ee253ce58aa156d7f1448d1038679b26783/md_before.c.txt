VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses kmalloc without checking for integer overflow on the size allocated, but does check for allocation failure. However, another vulnerability exists. The code does not check for a null pointer dereference on 'file' before setting 'ptr'.
 
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises because there is no null pointer check on 'ptr' when the code is setting the value for 'file'. There's also no allocation for the variable 'ptr', however considering this could have been made before and outside the context of the snippet this isn't being flagged for now. Also since the language in question is C, kmalloc allocates the memory for a struct which could potentially trigger integer overflow if 'sizeof(*file)' is too big. For kmalloc, though, the kernel limits allocations as it's safe from user code overwriting max allowed size to allocate.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
'ptr', you must ensure it's been allocated before this code is executed. Then set an upper-bound check on the memory size when using kmalloc. An upper-bound check is setting a predefined limit on the value of 'sizeof(*file)'. It should be the case here but ensure elsewhere the full context allows for the bounds check.
 
ORIGINAL CODE:
	char *ptr;
	int err;

	file = kmalloc(sizeof(*file), GFP_NOIO);
	if (!file)
		return -ENOMEM;

	err = 0;
