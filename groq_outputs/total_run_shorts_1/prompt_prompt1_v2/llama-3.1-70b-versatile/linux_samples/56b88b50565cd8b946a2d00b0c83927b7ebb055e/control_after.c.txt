VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The copy_to_user function can potentially overwrite a user space buffer that has been allocated with an insufficient size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
In the line that calls copy_to_user, there is no explicit check to ensure that the destination buffer (_control) is large enough to hold the data being copied. Although the size of the destination buffer is being passed as an argument to copy_to_user (sizeof(*control)), it does not prevent the potential for a buffer overflow if the user space buffer has been allocated with an insufficient size or if it has been subject to reallocation after initialization.

Additionally, we lack information about the variable `_control` but in the traditional `copy_to_user` usage, it is recommended that you clearly define what `_control` points to.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- In function `snd_ctl_elem_read_user` introduce a check before calling `copy_to_user` to ensure the destination buffer has been allocated with a sufficient size and is not null. If possible use something more type-safe like `user_copy` macros.

- If not already done elsewhere in the code, explicitly validate the size of the `control` struct. This could be done in the function definition where `control` is accepted.

- Include error checking on all allocations involving `control` and its destination buffer to prevent potential null pointer dereferences.

- Clearly define what `_control` points to. Perhaps an annotation alongside its declaration?

    ret = -EPERM;
    goto unlock;
