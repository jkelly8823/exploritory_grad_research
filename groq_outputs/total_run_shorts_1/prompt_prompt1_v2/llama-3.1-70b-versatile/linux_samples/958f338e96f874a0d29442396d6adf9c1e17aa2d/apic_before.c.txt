VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Out-of-Bounds Array Indexing
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes an array `disabled_cpus` with size `NR_CPUS`, however, it initializes values up to index `NR_CPUS - 1`. This is not inherently wrong but in some contexts might be at risk if the indexing starts at `NR_CPUS`. However there is a potential issue here. `NR_CPUS` might exceed the physical memory limit which might create a problem for this. Additionally, in the comments of the code it suggests to use certain APIs to allocate logical CPU IDs which could be an indication that the code might be modified at later time for a different memory allocation method.



RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Limit the number of processors by a `NR_MAX_PHYSICAL_CPUS` or some constant related to the systemâ€™s physical limitations and memory allowances of the CPU to catch such exceptions and prevent un-allocated extra memory access when switching between logical and physical CPUs.
- Perform input validation and boundary checking on `NR_CPUS` to prevent potential out-of-bounds array indexing.
- Use explicit loop variables instead of hardcoding the array index to prevent confusion and errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <asm/hypervisor.h>
#include <asm/cpu_device_id.h>
#include <asm/intel-family.h>

unsigned int num_processors;

unsigned disabled_cpus;
	[0 ... NR_CPUS - 1] = -1,
};

/*
 * Should use this API to allocate logical CPU IDs to keep nr_logical_cpuids
