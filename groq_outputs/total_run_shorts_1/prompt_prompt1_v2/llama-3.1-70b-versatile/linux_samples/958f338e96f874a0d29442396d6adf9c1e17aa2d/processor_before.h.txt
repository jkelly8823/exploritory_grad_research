VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a header file for x86 processor-related functions. It consists of function declarations and does not execute any code that could lead to vulnerabilities. Since this is just a function declarations header, no vulnerabilities can be identified from this code alone.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations can be provided as the code snippet does not execute any vulnerable code.
