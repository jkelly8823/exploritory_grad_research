VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a Linux kernel module that deals with page tables isolation. It includes various assembly-specific header files and defines a custom printf format for kernel messages. Since this snippet is mostly comprised of preprocessor directives and header inclusions, I do not detect any overt vulnerabilities.

The undefine and redefine of the `pr_fmt` macro does not appear to be exploitable as a vulnerability in this context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <asm/pgalloc.h>
#include <asm/tlbflush.h>
#include <asm/desc.h>
#include <asm/sections.h>

#undef pr_fmt
#define pr_fmt(fmt)     "Kernel/User page tables isolation: " fmt
```
