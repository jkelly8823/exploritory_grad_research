VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Open redirect vulnerability via user-controlled argument in a function.

EXPLANATION:
Upon analyzing the provided code snippet, an open redirect vulnerability has been identified in the `cpu_show_common` function. This function calls `sprintf(buf, "%s\n", ssb_strings[ssb_mode]);` to store the `ssb_mode` value into the `buf` with a newline character appended at the end. However, it is dangerous to directly insert unsanitized user-controlled data into a string that is displayed to users, because it may lead to an open redirect vulnerability, where an attacker may use a specially crafted value in `bug` variable to control the value in `buf` and inject malicious intent by leveraging an unsanitized print statement within a function call. 

Additionally, we do not know what `x86_amd_ssb_disable()` does when `X86_BUG_SPEC_STORE_BYPASS` is executed and closed to go back for another execution in a subsequent call.

The problem lies in that we don't know if the check for valid `X86_BUG_SPEC_STORE_BYPASS` meets certain safety measures defined for x86_32 platform SMP function calls and can prevent an unfettered error where uncontrolled path ends up executed or not.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) Further restrict `X86_BUG_SPEC_STORE_BYPASS` field access via current kernel versions and execution commands by defining an upper limit for similar `ssb_mode` arguments defined elsewhere in alternative cpu_show_common method implementations.
2) Remove newline character appended after user-controlled argument `ssb_strings[ssb_mode]` to limit potential open redirect impacts leveraging command injection.
3) Implement some validation checks to verify the integer bug values do not include malicious parameters in kernel function calls before invoking unparameterized execution functions providing a standard error/ return format within `cpu_show_common` method framework to address the following:
    - Direct access to specific internal x86 parameters hidden from execution format and command-line processor.
    - Safety-check user-controlled open redir path injection scenarios in input error correction for alternative methods.
