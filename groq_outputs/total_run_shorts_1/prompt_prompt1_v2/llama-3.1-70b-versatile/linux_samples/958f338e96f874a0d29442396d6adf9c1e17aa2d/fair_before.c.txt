VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a function declaration within a conditional preprocessor directive (#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT). It defines a static inline function set_idle_cores that takes two integer parameters. The function uses a pointer to a struct sched_domain_shared and is likely part of a scheduling system. However, with only this snippet, there's no obvious vulnerability or insecure practice.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet as it does not contain any identified vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT

static inline void set_idle_cores(int cpu, int val)
{
	struct sched_domain_shared *sds;
