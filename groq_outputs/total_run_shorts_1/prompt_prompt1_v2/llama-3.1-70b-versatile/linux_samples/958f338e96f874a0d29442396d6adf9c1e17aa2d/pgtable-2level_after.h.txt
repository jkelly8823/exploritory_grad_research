VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a collection of preprocessor directives and static inline functions for page table management on a 2-level page table system. The functions seem to be related to protections and guards, but they do not appear to be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. The `fixed` keywords on the function definitions also indicate that they are designed to be exception-safe and thread-safe. Due to the simplicity and the specific purpose of the functions, it is unlikely that they contain vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary in this case, as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
#define __pte_to_swp_entry(pte)		((swp_entry_t) { (pte).pte_low })
#define __swp_entry_to_pte(x)		((pte_t) { .pte = (x).val })

/* No inverted PFNs on 2 level page tables */

static inline u64 protnone_mask(u64 val)
{
	return 0;
}

static inline u64 flip_protnone_guard(u64 oldval, u64 val, u64 mask)
{
	return val;
}

static inline bool __pte_needs_invert(u64 val)
{
	return false;
}
