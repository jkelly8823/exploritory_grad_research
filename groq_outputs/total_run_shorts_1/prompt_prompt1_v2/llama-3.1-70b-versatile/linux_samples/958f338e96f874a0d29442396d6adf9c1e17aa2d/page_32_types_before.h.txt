VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a set of constants for physical and virtual memory masks. The `#ifdef` directive is used to conditionally define the `__PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT` and `__VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT` constants based on the value of the `CONFIG_X86_PAE` macro. This is a common and safe practice.

Additionally, the `#define N_EXCEPTION_STACKS 1` statement defines a constant without any potential security vulnerabilities. All the defined constants have fixed values, which do not depend on any external input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for change are needed for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define N_EXCEPTION_STACKS 1

#ifdef CONFIG_X86_PAE
/* 44=32+12, the limit we can fit into an unsigned long pfn */
#define __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT	44
#define __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT	32

#else  /* !CONFIG_X86_PAE */
#define __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT	32
```
