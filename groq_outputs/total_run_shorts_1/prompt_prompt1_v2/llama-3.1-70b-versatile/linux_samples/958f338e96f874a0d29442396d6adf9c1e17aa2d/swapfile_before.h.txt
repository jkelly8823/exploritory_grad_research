VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a header file for Linux kernel code. It only contains function and structure declarations. No executable code is present in this snippet, which makes it impossible to analyze for vulnerabilities in the classical sense. However, I can still provide some general advice on secure coding practices for the structures and functions declared here.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- When using structure pointers, ensure proper initialization and memory management to avoid memory leaks or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
- When passing values to functions, validate input parameters to prevent incorrect or malicious input.
- Keep in mind that function and variable names can be exploited for naming conflicts or other types of logical bugs.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern struct plist_head swap_active_head;
extern struct swap_info_struct *swap_info[];
extern int try_to_unuse(unsigned int, bool, unsigned long);

#endif /* _LINUX_SWAPFILE_H */
```
