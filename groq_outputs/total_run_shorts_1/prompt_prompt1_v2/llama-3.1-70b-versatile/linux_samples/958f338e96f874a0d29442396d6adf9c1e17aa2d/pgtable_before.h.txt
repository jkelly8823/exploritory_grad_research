VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities identified
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a portion of a low-level system programming interface, possibly related to Linux kernel code. After analyzing the provided code, I did not identify any software vulnerabilities. The code defines a static inline function, `init_espfix_bsp`, which is currently empty and does not perform any actions. The `#ifndef` directives and `#define` statements are used to conditionally define macros and functions, but do not introduce any vulnerabilities in this context.
RECOMMENDATIONS: No recommendations are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were identified. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that functions with empty implementations, such as `init_espfix_bsp`, are reviewed and tested to verify that they meet their intended requirements.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
static inline void init_espfix_bsp(void) { }
#endif

#endif /* !__ASSEMBLY__ */

#ifndef io_remap_pfn_range
#define io_remap_pfn_range remap_pfn_range
```
