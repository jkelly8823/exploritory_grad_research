VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability due to unbounded swap size calculation.

EXPLANATION:
The code calculates the maximum number of pages allowed for a single swap device based on the number of bits for the swap offset in the swp_entry_t type and the architecture definition of a swap pte. However, if the value of `swap_header->info.last_page` is very large, the `maxpages` variable, although having a fixed maximum value due to bit representation, can still lead to performance issues or slow system responses. The code does not enforce any reasonable bounds on the maximum size of the swap device, which could potentially lead to resource exhaustion or denial of service attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Introduce a sanity check for `swap_header->info.last_page` to prevent unbounded resource consumption.
2. Consider introducing a configurable limit for the maximum allowed swap size.
3. Evaluate the use of unsigned long for `maxpages` to avoid potential integer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return 0;
}

static unsigned long read_swap_header(struct swap_info_struct *p,
					union swap_header *swap_header,
					struct inode *inode)
{
	p->cluster_next = 1;
	p->cluster_nr = 0;

	/*
	 * Find out how many pages are allowed for a single swap
	 * device. There are two limiting factors: 1) the number
	 * of bits for the swap offset in the swp_entry_t type, and
	 * 2) the number of bits in the swap pte as defined by the
	 * different architectures. In order to find the
	 * largest possible bit mask, a swap entry with swap type 0
	 * and swap offset ~0UL is created, encoded to a swap pte,
	 * decoded to a swp_entry_t again, and finally the swap
	* offset is extracted. This will mask all the bits from
	* the initial ~0UL mask that can't be encoded in either
	* the swp_entry_t or the architecture definition of a
	* swap pte.
	*/
	maxpages = swp_offset(pte_to_swp_entry(
			swp_entry_to_pte(swp_entry(0, ~0UL)))) + 1;
	last_page = swap_header->info.last_page;
	if (!last_page) {
		pr_warn("Empty swap-file\n");
		return 0;
