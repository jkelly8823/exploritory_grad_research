VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of the Linux kernel source, specifically related to KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) functionality. The provided code is primarily struct definitions and function declarations. There are no obvious signs of vulnerabilities or security concerns within this snippet.

However, it's essential to note that potential vulnerabilities could be introduced by how these functions and structures are implemented or used elsewhere in the codebase. Since this is just a snippet, a full analysis is not possible.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made as the code snippet appears secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/tracepoint.h>
#include <linux/cpumask.h>
#include <linux/irq_work.h>
#include <linux/irq.h>

#include <linux/kvm.h>

#include <linux/kvm_types.h>

    /* be preempted when it's in kernel-mode(cpl=0) */
    bool preempted_in_kernel;

    /* Flush the L1 Data cache for L1TF mitigation on VMENTER */
    bool l1tf_flush_l1d;
