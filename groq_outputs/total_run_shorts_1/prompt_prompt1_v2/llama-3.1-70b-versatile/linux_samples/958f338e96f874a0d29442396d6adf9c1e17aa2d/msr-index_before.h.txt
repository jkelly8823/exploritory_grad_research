VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities found in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided consists of macro definitions for several MSR (Model-Specific Registers) addresses and their corresponding bit positions. These registers are used in low-level programming to access and manipulate hardware features. 

Upon examination, there are no apparent vulnerabilities in the code. The definitions do not involve any user input or data processing that could potentially be exploited.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are needed, as none were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c

#define ARCH_CAP_SSB_NO			(1 << 4)   /*
						    * Not susceptible to Speculative Store Bypass
						    * attack, so no Speculative Store Bypass
