VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a scheduling-related function in an operating system (likely Linux). It checks for the presence of CONFIG_SCHED_SMT and defines a static key for it. Then, it defines a static inline function set_idle_cores(). This function takes two integer parameters and declares a local variable sds.

The code snippet does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of untrusted input, or other potential security issues. It appears to be a simple function declaration with no obvious security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
}
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_FALSE(sched_smt_present);

static inline void set_idle_cores(int cpu, int val)
{
	struct sched_domain_shared *sds;
