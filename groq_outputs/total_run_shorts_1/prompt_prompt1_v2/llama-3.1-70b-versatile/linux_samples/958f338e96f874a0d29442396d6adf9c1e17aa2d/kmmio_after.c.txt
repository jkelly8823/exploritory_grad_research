VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Uninitialized Variable and Wrong Assumptions
EXPLANATION: 
The `clear_pmd_presence` and `clear_pte_presence` functions make assumptions about the initial state of the `clear` variable and its past values. The functions assume that `clear` was `true` previously when `clear` is `false`. However, this is not guaranteed and might lead to incorrect behavior.

Moreover, the initialization of the `new_pmd` and `old` values in the `clear_pmd_presence` and `clear_pte_presence` functions are not checked for any errors. The `pte_clear` function in `clear_pte_presence` is called without checking if the pte is already cleared which might lead to undefined behavior.

Another issue is the assumption that the `init_mm` is already initialized and can be used in the `pte_clear` function call.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Add error checking for the `new_pmd` and `old` values initialization.
- Ensure that the `clear` variable is properly initialized and its state is tracked.
- Consider using a state machine or flags to track the pmd and pte presence state instead of relying on the `clear` variable.
- Verify the initialization of `init_mm` before using it in the `pte_clear` function call.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
static void clear_pmd_presence(pmd_t *pmd, bool clear, pmdval_t *old)
{
	pmd_t new_pmd;
	pmdval_t v = pmd_val(*pmd);
	if (clear) {
		*old = v;
		new_pmd = pmd_mknotpresent(*pmd);
	} else {
		/* Presume this has been called with clear==true previously */
		new_pmd = __pmd(*old);
	}
	set_pmd(pmd, new_pmd);
}

static void clear_pte_presence(pte_t *pte, bool clear, pteval_t *old)
{
	pteval_t v = pte_val(*pte);
	if (clear) {
		*old = v;
		/* Nothing should care about address */
		pte_clear(&init_mm, 0, pte);
	} else {
		/* Presume this has been called with clear==true previously */
		set_pte_atomic(pte, __pte(*old));
	}
}

static int clear_page_presence(struct kmmio_fault_page *f, bool clear)
{ 
```
