VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a snippet from a function that handles multiple CPUs. It uses a ternary operator to determine whether to append 's' to `num_nodes` and `num_cpus` depending on their values. The snippet also contains a call to the `smp_cpus_done` function. However, there are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this code.
 
 While the code snippet seems incomplete (e.g., the function definition or arguments are not shown), within the context of the given code, there does not appear to be any insecure practices or potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
		num_nodes, (num_nodes > 1 ? "s" : ""),
		num_cpus,  (num_cpus  > 1 ? "s" : ""));

	/* Any cleanup work */
	smp_cpus_done(setup_max_cpus);
```
