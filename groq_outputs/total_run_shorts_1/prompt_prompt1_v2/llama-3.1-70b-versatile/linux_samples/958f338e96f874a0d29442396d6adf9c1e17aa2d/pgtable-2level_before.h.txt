VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential type casting vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION:
The provided code defines two macros, `__pte_to_swp_entry` and `__swp_entry_to_pte`, which cast between different types without proper validation. Specifically, the `(swp_entry_t)` and `(pte_t)` casts can potentially cause unexpected behavior if the underlying type is not compatible.

The primary concern here is that these macros might be used in contexts where they could lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or even security vulnerabilities if not properly validated or sanitized.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this potential vulnerability:

*   Validate and sanitize the input values for both macros to ensure they fit within the expected type bounds.
*   Implement error handling or assertions to catch any potential invalid type conversions.
*   Avoid using C-style casts, as they can mask issues. Instead, opt for safer casting methods or functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define __pte_to_swp_entry(pte)		((swp_entry_t) { (pte).pte_low })
#define __swp_entry_to_pte(x)		((pte_t) { .pte = (x).val })

#endif /* _ASM_X86_PGTABLE_2LEVEL_H */
```
