VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a function in C, possibly related to system configuration or initialization. The snippet includes conditional statements and function calls. However, without additional context, the functions `cpu_smt_check_topology()` and `smp_cpus_done()` seem secure as they do not reveal any identifiable vulnerability. The conditional statements are also properly formatted and do not pose a threat.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided, as no vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	num_nodes, (num_nodes > 1 ? "s" : ""),
	num_cpus,  (num_cpus  > 1 ? "s" : "");

	/* Final decision about SMT support */
	cpu_smt_check_topology();
	/* Any cleanup work */
	smp_cpus_done(setup_max_cpus);
}
```
