VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Missing prototypes for external function calls and unbalanced brace in nested function invocation

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet has a missing close brace on line 13 and an extra open brace on line 14, which leads to incorrect function nesting. Also, the `ack_APIC_irq()` function is called without a prototype declaration. This could potentially lead to issues with correct function linkage and increase the likelihood of errors in the function's invocation. Moreover, prototypes are not only useful for checking function call validity but also for type checking parameters passed to external functions.

Additionally, there seems to be missing prototypes or declarations for `irq_enter()` and `irq_exit()` functions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Include the missing close brace for the function declaration on line 13 and remove the unnecessary open brace on line 14. 
- Include the prototype declaration for `ack_APIC_irq()` function before its invocation. 
- Ensure that all external function calls are correctly prototyped to prevent incorrect linkage.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <asm/fixmap.h>
#include <asm/mpspec.h>
#include <asm/msr.h>

#define ARCH_APICTIMER_STOPS_ON_C3	1

/*

#endif /* CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC */

extern void irq_enter(void);
extern void irq_exit(void);

static inline void entering_irq(void)
{
	irq_enter();
}

static inline void entering_ack_irq(void)
{
	irq_enter();
	ack_APIC_irq();
}

static inline void exiting_irq(void)
{
```

Note: I've assumed that there's a missing function declaration `ack_APIC_irq()` with its corresponding prototype declaration elsewhere in the code.
