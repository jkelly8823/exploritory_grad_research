VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a set of include statements, which are import declarations in C. These statements are used to include header files that provide implementations of procedures and data used in the program. 

In general, import statements like these are not a source of vulnerabilities, assuming the included libraries themselves are secure and up-to-date. Without the content of these libraries, we cannot assess their security. However, based on this code snippet alone, there is no indication of any vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommended fixes are necessary for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/acpi.h>
#include <linux/device.h>
#include <linux/pci.h>
#include <linux/pm_runtime.h>
