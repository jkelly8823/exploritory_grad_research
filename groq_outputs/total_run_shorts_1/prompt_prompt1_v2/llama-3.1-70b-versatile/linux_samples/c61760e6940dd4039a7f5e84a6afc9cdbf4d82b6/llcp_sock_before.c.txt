VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unintended memory leak due to an unbalanced free operation. If the `llcp_sock->service_name` memory allocation fails to be freed under certain conditions, this may lead to a memory leak.

EXPLANATION:
The code seems to handle socket release and puts device. However, in the case where `nfc_llcp_get_local_ssap(local)` succeeds in the first try and `nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock)` fails, `kfree(llcp_sock->service_name)` is executed. This `kfree(llcp_sock->service_name)` seems to be missing in other blocks, specifically when `nfc_llcp_get_local_ssap(local)` is called and `nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock)` never gets called. This could result in an unintended memory leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the potential memory leak issue, add `kfree(llcp_sock->service_name)` in the case when `nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock)` is not called, specifically after the `llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_local_ssap(local)` line.

This possible fix:
```c
llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_local_ssap(local);
if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {
    nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local);
    kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);  // Add this line to prevent potential memory leak
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto put_dev;
}
```
Also for better handling of `llcp_sock->service_name`, consider freeing it at a centralized location (e.g. a dedicated function) to prevent code duplication.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
GFP_KERNEL);
if (!llcp_sock->service_name) {
    nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local);
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto put_dev;
}
llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock);
if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {
    nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local);
    kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);
    llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;
    ret = -EADDRINUSE;
    goto put_dev;
}
llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_local_ssap(local);
if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {
    nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local);
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto put_dev;
}

sock_llcp_release:
    nfc_llcp_put_ssap(local, llcp_sock->ssap);
    nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local);

put_dev:
    nfc_put_device(dev);
```
