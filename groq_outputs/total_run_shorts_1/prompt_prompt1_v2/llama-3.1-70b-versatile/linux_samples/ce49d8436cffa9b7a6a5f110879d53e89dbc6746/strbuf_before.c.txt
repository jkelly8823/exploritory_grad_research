VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is well-protected from vulnerabilities. The `vsnprintf` function is used with checks to prevent potential buffer overflows, and the buffer is resized as needed to prevent overflowing. Additionally, `va_copy` and `va_end` are used correctly to manage the variadic argument list, preventing potential issues with the arguments.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be well-designed to prevent common vulnerabilities in string manipulation.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	va_copy(ap_saved, ap);
	len = vsnprintf(sb->buf + sb->len, sb->alloc - sb->len, fmt, ap);
	if (len < 0)
		return len;
	if (len > strbuf_avail(sb)) {
		ret = strbuf_grow(sb, len);
		if (ret)
			return ret;
		len = vsnprintf(sb->buf + sb->len, sb->alloc - sb->len, fmt, ap_saved);
		va_end(ap_saved);
		if (len > strbuf_avail(sb)) {
			pr_debug("this should not happen, your vsnprintf is broken");
			return -EINVAL;
		}
	}
	return strbuf_setlen(sb, sb->len + len);
}
