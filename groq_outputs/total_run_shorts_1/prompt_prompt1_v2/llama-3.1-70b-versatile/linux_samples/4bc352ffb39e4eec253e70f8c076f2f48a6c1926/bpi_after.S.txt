VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an ARM assembly macro. It defines a macro named `smccc_workaround_1` that seems to perform some kind of stack frame setup and save/restore operations.

Upon reviewing the code, there are no obvious vulnerabilities identified. The memory addresses used in the `stp` instructions appear to be stack-based and relative to the current stack pointer (`sp`), and the allocation of stack space using the `sub` instruction seems to be effectively 32 bytes (8*4).

The use of stack frame setup and save/restore instructions can sometimes lead to issues with stack corruption or improper memory management. However, in this context, the code appears to be well-formed and does not introduce any obvious vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Given the absence of identified vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet, no specific recommendations can be made for fixing the code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
