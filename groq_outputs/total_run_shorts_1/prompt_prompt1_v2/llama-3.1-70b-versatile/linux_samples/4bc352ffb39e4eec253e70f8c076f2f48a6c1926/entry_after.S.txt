VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a short assembly code segment that contains an instruction to exit a function (`eret`) and a directive to mark the end of a procedure (`ENDPROC`). Without any contextual information or additional code, this snippet does not reveal any obvious vulnerabilities. The `eret` instruction appears to be a standard operation in ARM64 assembly, which exits the current exception level. The `ENDPROC` directive is used for debugging purposes and does not directly affect the program's behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
    eret
ENDPROC(__fpsimd_guest_restore)
```
