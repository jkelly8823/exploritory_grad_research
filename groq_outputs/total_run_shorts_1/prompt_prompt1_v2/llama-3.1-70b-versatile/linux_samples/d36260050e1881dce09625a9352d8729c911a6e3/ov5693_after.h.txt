VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No known vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a small portion of a struct definition, specifically defining a camera resolution configuration for the OV5693 sensor. After analyzing the code, no apparent vulnerabilities were found. The code consists of a pre-defined enum-like identifier and a struct array definition. It does not contain any user input handling, memory management, or arithmetic operations that could potentially introduce a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
