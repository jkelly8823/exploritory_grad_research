VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a struct definition, declaring several variables of different data types. I have analyzed the code and did not find any potential security vulnerabilities. The data types are all native C types, and there are no signs of user input or operations that could be exploited. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
const struct ia_css_frame_info  *in_info;
const struct ia_css_frame_info  *internal_info;
bool two_ppc;
enum atomisp_input_format stream_format;
bool deinterleaved;
uint8_t enable_left_padding;
