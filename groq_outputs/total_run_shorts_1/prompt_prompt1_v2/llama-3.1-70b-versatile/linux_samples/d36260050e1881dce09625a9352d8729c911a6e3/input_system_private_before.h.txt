VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a couple of functions for storing and loading data to/from a register. It includes assertions to ensure the provided input IDs are within valid ranges. While the use of asserts can be used to enforce program invariants, they do not typically introduce vulnerabilities in and of themselves, and their usage here is reasonable for validation purposes. Without additional context, such as the potential values that are expected to be passed to these functions, or more information about the programming environment, there are no obvious vulnerabilities to report.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None are needed as there are no identified vulnerabilities.
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
STORAGE_CLASS_INPUT_SYSTEM_C void receiver_port_reg_store(
	const rx_ID_t				ID,
	const mipi_port_ID_t			port_ID,
	const hrt_address			reg,
	const hrt_data				value)
{
	assert(ID < N_RX_ID);

STORAGE_CLASS_INPUT_SYSTEM_C hrt_data receiver_port_reg_load(
	const rx_ID_t				ID,
	const mipi_port_ID_t			port_ID,
	const hrt_address			reg)
{
	assert(ID < N_RX_ID);
	assert(port_ID < N_MIPI_PORT_ID);
