VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
After thoroughly evaluating the provided code snippet, I have not identified any potential vulnerabilities. The given code appears to be function prototypes or function declarations with proper use of parameter passing and data type handling.

However, please note that without the actual function implementations or usage context, it's challenging to perform an exhaustive vulnerability assessment. Potential issues might be uncovered in the function bodies or during the usage of these functions in the larger codebase.

In this specific snippet, I looked for potential indicators of vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, unhandled exceptions, data serialization, or insecure direct object references. None were found.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
