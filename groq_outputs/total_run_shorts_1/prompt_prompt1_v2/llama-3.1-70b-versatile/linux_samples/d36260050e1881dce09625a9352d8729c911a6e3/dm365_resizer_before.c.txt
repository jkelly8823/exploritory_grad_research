VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uncontrolled recursion in a function leads to a potential stack overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a function that configures a resizer device. However, the function calls itself recursively under certain conditions without any clear termination condition or checks to prevent stack overflow. This can lead to infinite recursion if the function does not return within a finite number of recursive calls.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the recursive function calls are properly bounded and have a clear termination condition. This could involve introducing additional checks or moving the logic to a loop-based implementation to prevent stack overflows. Here's a possible recommendation:

```c
static int
resizer_configure_in_continious_mode(struct vpfe_resizer_device *resizer)
{
    // ...
    bool is_configured = false;
    while (!is_configured && /* some other condition */)
    {
        if (/* condition that triggered recursion */)
        {
            // Perform the necessary actions here without recursion
            // ...
            is_configured = true;
        }
        else
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return 0;
}
static int
resizer_configure_in_continious_mode(struct vpfe_resizer_device *resizer)
{
    struct device *dev = resizer->crop_resizer.subdev.v4l2_dev->dev;
    struct resizer_params *param = &resizer->config;
    struct vpfe_rsz_config_params *cont_config;
    ipipeif_source == IPIPEIF_OUTPUT_RESIZER)
                ret = resizer_configure_in_single_shot_mode(resizer);
        else
                ret =  resizer_configure_in_continious_mode(resizer);
        if (ret)
                return ret;
        ret = config_rsz_hw(resizer, param);
}
