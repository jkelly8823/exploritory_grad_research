VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow in the `print_csi_rx_errors` and `atomisp_css_rx_get_irq_info` functions.
EXPLANATION:
The `print_csi_rx_errors` function uses a loop to iterate over the CSI2 ports and call the `atomisp_css_rx_get_irq_info` function for each port. However, the buffer size of the `rx_infos` variable is not checked, and it is possible to overflow the buffer if the number of errors is large.
Additionally, the `atomisp_css_rx_clear_irq_info` function is called with the `rx_infos` value, which could also lead to a buffer overflow if the value is not properly validated.
The lack of bounds checking and validation in these functions makes them vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the buffer size of the `rx_infos` variable before calling the `atomisp_css_rx_get_irq_info` function.
2. Implement bounds checking in the `atomisp_css_rx_clear_irq_info` function to prevent overflow.
3. Consider using a safer buffer management approach, such as using a dynamically allocated buffer or a fixed-size buffer with overflow detection.
ORIGINAL CODE:


```c
static void print_csi_rx_errors(enum ia_css_csi2_port port,
				struct atomisp_device *isp)
{
	u32 infos = 0;

}

...

    for (port = IA_CSS_CSI2_PORT0; port <= IA_CSS_CSI2_PORT2;
	     port++) {
		print_csi_rx_errors(port, isp);
		atomisp_css_rx_get_irq_info(port, &rx_infos);
		atomisp_css_rx_clear_irq_info(port, rx_infos);
```
