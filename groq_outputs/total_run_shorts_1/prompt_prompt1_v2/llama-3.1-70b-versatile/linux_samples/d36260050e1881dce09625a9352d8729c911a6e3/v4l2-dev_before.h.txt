VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines an enumeration (enum) for device node types and a macro constant for the maximum value. It also begins to define an enum for device directions, but this definition is incomplete. Since this is a simple enumeration and macro definition, there are no apparent security vulnerabilities or issues in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
