VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be a portion of a function that retrieves clock sources for a JPEG decoder. It checks for error conditions when retrieving the clock sources and returns an error code (-EINVAL) if either retrieval fails. This code follows standard practices for error handling in kernel development and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	jpeg->clk_jdec = devm_clk_get(jpeg->dev, "jpgdec");
	if (IS_ERR(jpeg->clk_jdec))
		return -EINVAL;

	jpeg->clk_jdec_smi = devm_clk_get(jpeg->dev, "jpgdec-smi");
	if (IS_ERR(jpeg->clk_jdec_smi))
		return -EINVAL;

	return 0;
