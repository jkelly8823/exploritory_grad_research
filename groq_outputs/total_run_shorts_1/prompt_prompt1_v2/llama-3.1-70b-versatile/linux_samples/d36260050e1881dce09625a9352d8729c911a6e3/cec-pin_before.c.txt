VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 17-20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbounded Counter Increment Vulnerability. The counter `rx_data_bit_too_short_cnt` is not checked for overflow before being incremented, which can lead to an integer wraparound vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the counter `rx_data_bit_too_short_cnt` is incremented without any bounds checking. If this counter reaches its maximum value and is incremented again, it will wrap around to a lower value. This can cause unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. Although the impact of this vulnerability may be limited in this specific context, it's still a potential security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, bounds checking should be implemented before incrementing the counter `rx_data_bit_too_short_cnt`. Here is an example of how to do this:

```c
if (pin->rx_data_bit_too_short_cnt < UINT_MAX) {
    pin->rx_data_bit_too_short_cnt++;
    pin->rx_data_bit_too_short_ts = pin->ts;
    pin->rx_data_bit_too_short_delta = delta;
} else {
    // Handle the case where the counter has reached its maximum value
    // This could involve logging an error or taking other action
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (delta < CEC_TIM_START_BIT_LOW_MIN - CEC_TIM_IDLE_SAMPLE) {
    if (!pin->rx_start_bit_low_too_short_cnt++) {
        pin->rx_start_bit_low_too_short_ts = pin->ts;
        pin->rx_start_bit_low_too_short_delta = delta;
    }
    cec_pin_to_idle(pin);
    break;
/* Start bit is too short, go back to idle */
if (delta < CEC_TIM_START_BIT_TOTAL_MIN - CEC_TIM_IDLE_SAMPLE) {
    if (!pin->rx_start_bit_too_short_cnt++) {
        pin->rx_start_bit_too_short_ts = pin->ts;
        pin->rx_start_bit_too_short_delta = delta;
    }
    cec_pin_to_idle(pin);
    break;
    */
if (delta < CEC_TIM_DATA_BIT_TOTAL_MIN) {
    if (!pin->rx_data_bit_too_short_cnt++) {
        pin->rx_data_bit_too_short_ts = pin->ts;
        pin->rx_data_bit_too_short_delta = delta;
    }
    cec_pin_low(pin);
    pin->state = CEC_ST_RX_LOW_DRIVE;
```
