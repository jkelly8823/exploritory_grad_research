VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Global Variable Usage Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The function `debug_buffer_init` uses a global variable `debug_data_ptr`, which points to a static variable `debug_data`. This can potentially lead to issues where the function modifies the global state in an unexpected way. However, without further context, this might not be a concern.

But, what stands out is that this function takes an `hrt_address addr` as input but does not seem to use it to initialize anything. Instead, there are two lines at the beginning of the code snippet that set two variables to -1. It seems like the intention was to initialize `debug_buffer_address` and `debug_buffer_ddr_address` with the input `addr`, but this is not happening.

A more concerning issue is that `debug_buffer_ddr_address` and `debug_buffer_address` are not being used within this code snippet but it sets them to -1 which may cause a problem when it's used somewhere else.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Review the code that calls `debug_buffer_init` and ensure that the `addr` parameter is being used correctly. It would also be beneficial to review the usage of `debug_buffer_ddr_address` and `debug_buffer_address` elsewhere in the codebase.

Consider passing the `addr` parameter to the `debug_data_ptr` initialization or using it to set other related variables like `hrt_address` and `hrt_vaddress` instances.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
hrt_address	debug_buffer_address = (hrt_address)-1;
hrt_vaddress	debug_buffer_ddr_address = (hrt_vaddress)-1;
/* The local copy */
static debug_data_t		debug_data;
debug_data_t		*debug_data_ptr = &debug_data;

void debug_buffer_init(const hrt_address addr)
{
} 
```
