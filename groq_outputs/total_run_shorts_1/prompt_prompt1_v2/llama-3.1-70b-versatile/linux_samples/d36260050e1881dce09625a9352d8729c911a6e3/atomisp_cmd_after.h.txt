VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of three function declarations and does not execute any logic or interact with user input, which is where vulnerabilities typically originate. 

This code appears to be part of a larger system and includes various function prototypes, including callbacks for an End-of-Frame event, a function to retrieve a MIPI port ID, and a function to check if a video pipe is for a viewfinder.

Without more context, such as the implementations of these functions or the data structures used, it is difficult to pinpoint potential vulnerabilities in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for changes to the code are provided as no potential vulnerabilities have been identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void atomisp_eof_event(struct atomisp_sub_device *asd, uint8_t exp_id);

enum mipi_port_id __get_mipi_port(struct atomisp_device *isp,
				enum atomisp_camera_port port);

bool atomisp_is_vf_pipe(struct atomisp_video_pipe *pipe);
```
