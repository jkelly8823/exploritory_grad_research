VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not find any obvious security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be defining a static struct array `gc0310_res_preview` with fields describing display resolutions. There is no evidence of user input being processed or insecure system calls being made.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
{GC0310_TOK_TERM, 0, 0},
};

static struct gc0310_resolution gc0310_res_preview[] = {
	{
		.desc = "gc0310_VGA_30fps",
		.width = 656, // 648,
		.height = 496, // 488,
