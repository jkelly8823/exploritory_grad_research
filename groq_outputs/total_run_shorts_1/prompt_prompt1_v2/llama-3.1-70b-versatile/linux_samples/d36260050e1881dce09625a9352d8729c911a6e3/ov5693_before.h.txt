VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was identified in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a struct array and populates it with values. There are no obvious issues that could lead to a security vulnerability, such as user input not being validated or data being copied without proper bounds checking. 
However, without the definitions of `OV5693_TOK_TERM` and `struct ov5693_resolution`, it's impossible to fully analyze this code for vulnerabilities. But, in isolation, this snippet appears secure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{OV5693_TOK_TERM, 0, 0}
};

struct ov5693_resolution ov5693_res_preview[] = {
	{
		.desc = "ov5693_736x496_30fps",
		.width = 736,
		.height = 496,
