VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet. This code defines a struct ia_css_metadata_config, which appears to be used for processing sensor metadata. The code seems to follow best practices for struct definitions and does not contain any suspicious or vulnerable patterns.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, there are no recommended fixes. However, to maintain code quality and security, the following best practices can be followed:

- Ensure that the struct's fields are properly initialized and validated when creating instances of this struct.
- Check for potential null pointer dereferences or out-of-bounds access when accessing the struct's members.
- Consider using a more explicit naming convention for the enum and struct names to avoid potential naming conflicts.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 * to process sensor metadata.
 */
struct ia_css_metadata_config {
	enum atomisp_input_format data_type; /** Data type of CSI-2 embedded
			data. The default value is ATOMISP_INPUT_FORMAT_EMBEDDED. For
			certain sensors, user can choose non-default data type for embedded
			data. */
	struct ia_css_resolution  resolution; /** Resolution */
};
