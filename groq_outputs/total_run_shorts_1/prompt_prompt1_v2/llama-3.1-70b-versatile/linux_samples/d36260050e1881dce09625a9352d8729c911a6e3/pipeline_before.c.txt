VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is quite short and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It includes some preprocessor directives and function definitions, but it does not perform any potentially vulnerable operations such as user input processing, file I/O, or dynamic memory allocation. The `assert` statement checks the value of `found_sp_thread`, but it does not introduce a vulnerability itself, as it just terminates the program if the condition is not met.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
