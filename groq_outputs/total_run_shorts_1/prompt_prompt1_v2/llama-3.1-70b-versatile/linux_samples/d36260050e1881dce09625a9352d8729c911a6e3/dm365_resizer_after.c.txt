VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential deadlock or infinite recursion due to recursive function calls without proper base case.

EXPLANATION:
The function `resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode` is calling itself within the given code snippet. However, there is no proper base case or conditional statement that prevents infinite recursion. This can lead to a potential deadlock or infinite recursion error, as the function may continue to call itself until the program runs out of stack space.

Additionally, on line 6, `resizer_configure_in_single_shot_mode` is being called with a similar risk. However, since its implementation is not provided, its vulnerability assessment cannot be accurately performed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Introduce a base case or a conditional statement to prevent infinite recursion.
2.  Verify that the recursive calls are properly synchronized, especially if multiple threads are accessing this functionality.
3.  Refactor the code to use an iterative approach instead of recursion, if possible.
4.  Check the implementation of `resizer_configure_in_single_shot_mode` for similar recursive function call issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	return 0;
}
static int
resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode(struct vpfe_resizer_device *resizer)
{
	struct device *dev = resizer->crop_resizer.subdev.v4l2_dev->dev;
	struct resizer_params *param = &resizer->config;
	struct vpfe_rsz_config_params *cont_config;
		    ipipeif_source == IPIPEIF_OUTPUT_RESIZER)
			ret = resizer_configure_in_single_shot_mode(resizer);
		else
			ret =  resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode(resizer);
		if (ret)
			return ret;
		ret = config_rsz_hw(resizer, param);
	}
