VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A static assertion vulnerability is potentially present due to the use of `BUILD_BUG_ON` macro.

EXPLANATION:
The `BUILD_BUG_ON` macro will trigger a compile-time assertion if the condition within it is not met. In this case, the condition checks if the size of the `width_field` and `height_field` members of the struct is equal to the size of `u32`. However, this check is performed at compile-time and only checks the size of the members, not their actual types.

If the types of `width_field` and `height_field` are not `u32`, but have the same size as `u32` (e.g., if they are unsigned integers of the same size), this assertion will pass, but the code may still behave incorrectly.

Furthermore, the `BUILD_BUG_ON` macro will not catch cases where the types are `u32` but the `width_field` and `height_field` members are not actually used to store `u32` values.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Replace `BUILD_BUG_ON` with an explicit assertion that checks the type of `width_field` and `height_field` instead of just their size.
2.  Alternatively, use a more advanced static analysis tool or a code review process to ensure that `width_field` and `height_field` are always used to store `u32` values.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
 *	set of resolutions contained in an array of a driver specific struct.
 *
 * @array: a driver specific array of image sizes
 * @array_size: the length of the driver specific array of image sizes
 * @width_field: the name of the width field in the driver specific struct
 * @height_field: the name of the height field in the driver specific struct
 * @width: desired width.
 * @height: desired height.
 *
 * Returns the best match or NULL if the length of the array is zero.
