VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. It is a function declaration, and the function handles an enumeration value.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a function declaration, which by itself does not provide enough information to identify any potential vulnerabilities. The function takes an enumeration type as input, which suggests a level of control and validation over the input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet. However, similar functions in the same codebase should be reviewed to ensure they handle invalid or unexpected inputs properly.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <ia_css_stream_format.h>

unsigned int sh_css_stream_format_2_bits_per_subpixel(
        enum ia_css_stream_format format);

#endif /* __SH_CSS_STREAM_FORMAT_H */
```
