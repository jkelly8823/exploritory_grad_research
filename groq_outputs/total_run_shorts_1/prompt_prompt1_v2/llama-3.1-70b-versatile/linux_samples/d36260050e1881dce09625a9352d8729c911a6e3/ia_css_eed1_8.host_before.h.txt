VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found
EXPLANATION: This code snippet is a function declaration for `ia_css_eed1_8_vmem_encode`. It includes necessary header files and begins to define a function, but does not provide enough code to reveal any vulnerabilities. The function takes a pointer to a `struct eed1_8_vmem_params` as a parameter, but since the code snippet does not show how this structure is used within the function, no vulnerabilities can be identified. Without additional code, we cannot assess potential issues such as null pointer dereferences, unchecked memory reads, or out-of-bounds access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
