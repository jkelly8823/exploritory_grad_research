VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerability in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a static initialization of a 2D array in C. It is defining a constant array named `g_pyramid` with a predefined set of values. There are no signs of potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use after free, or other common issues in the given code.

The array sizes are explicitly defined and no dynamic memory allocation is performed, which reduces the risk of memory-related issues. Furthermore, the array is declared as `const`, which indicates that it is intended to be read-only, which helps prevent unexpected changes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are provided for this code as no vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
