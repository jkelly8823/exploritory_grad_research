VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines several structures and initializes them, but it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The arrays and structures are properly defined and initialized, and there is no evidence of buffer overflows, invalid pointer usage, or other common security issues. The code appears to be a basic data structure definition and initialization, with no apparent security concerns.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided, as no vulnerabilities were detected.
