VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a possible integer overflow vulnerability. The lines of code initialize `hrt_address` and `hrt_vaddress` variables with an invalid address by subtracting 1 from an unsigned integer value. This can lead to an undersigned value which, in turn, could be interpreted as a very large unsigned integer, potentially causing unforeseen behavior elsewhere in the system.
EXPLANATION:
The issue arises from performing arithmetic operations on unsigned integers. Since `hrt_address` and `hrt_vaddress` are unsigned values (their names imply they are related to memory addresses), subtracting 1 from them would cause an underflow and wrap them around to their maximum value, effectively causing a large number to be stored. This underflowed value may cause errors elsewhere in the system if the variable is later used as an array index or for pointer arithmetic.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid subtracting 1 from unsigned integer values to prevent underflow. 
2. Ensure that the initialized variables hold valid memory addresses. 
3. Validate inputs, especially in case `hrt_address` or `hrt_vaddress` are dependent on user input or other untrusted sources.

ORIGINAL CODE:
hrt_address	debug_buffer_address = (hrt_address)-1;
hrt_vaddress	debug_buffer_ddr_address = (hrt_vaddress)-1;
/* The local copy */
debug_data_t		debug_data;
debug_data_t		*debug_data_ptr = &debug_data;

void debug_buffer_init(const hrt_address addr)
