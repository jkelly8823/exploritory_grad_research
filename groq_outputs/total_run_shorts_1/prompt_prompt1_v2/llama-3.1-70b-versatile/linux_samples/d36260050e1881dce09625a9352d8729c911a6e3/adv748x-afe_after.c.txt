VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of a function that interacts with a mutex and multiple structs. It checks the `enable` condition and assigns a value to the `signal` variable. Given the information provided, there is no evident vulnerability such as a null pointer dereference, buffer overflow, or use-after-free.
