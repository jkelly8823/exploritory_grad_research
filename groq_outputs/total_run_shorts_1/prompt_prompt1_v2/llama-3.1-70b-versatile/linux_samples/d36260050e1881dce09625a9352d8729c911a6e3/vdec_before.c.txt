VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds read in format type check

EXPLANATION:
The provided code checks for a specific format type (`V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT_MPLANE`) and calls the `venus_helper_check_codec` function if this condition is met. However, the `venus_helper_check_codec` function uses an unchecked `pixfmt` field from the `fmt` array without validating whether the index `i` is within the valid range of indices that have a valid `pixfmt` value. 

This could potentially result in out-of-bounds access, which can cause undefined behavior if not handled correctly. 

This may have been missed due to lack of bounds checking when `venus_helper_check_codec` was called or missing length checks on `img` formats, resulting in such an edge case.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this potential vulnerability, it is recommended to add bounds checks for the `pixfmt` field in the `venus_helper_check_codec` function before accessing it. This can be achieved by adding length checks for image formats and ensuring that the `fmt` array does not go past an acceptable size.

It is also advisable to validate the index `i` before using `fmt[i]`. Additionally, in the code snippet, the `size` variable is not validated if it contains acceptable values before looping through `i`. The addition of these safety precautions would prevent a potential out-of-bounds vulnerability.


ORIGINAL CODE:

		return NULL;

	for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		if (fmt[i].type != type)
			continue;
		if (k == index)
			break;
		k++;
	}

	if (i == size)
		return NULL;

	if (type == V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT_MPLANE &&
	    !venus_helper_check_codec(inst, fmt[i].pixfmt))
		return NULL;

	return &fmt[i];
