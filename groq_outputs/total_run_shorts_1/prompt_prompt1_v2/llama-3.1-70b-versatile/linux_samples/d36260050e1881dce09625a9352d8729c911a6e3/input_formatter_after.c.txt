VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No specific vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be a function declaration and an array definition with a constant value. The code does not contain any obvious signs of vulnerabilities such as user input validation issues, off-by-one errors, or potential buffer overflows. The function input_formatter_rst takes a const parameter which limits the potential for modification through the function call. Without a complete code review or context, it's impossible to identify any potential vulnerabilities that may arise from function call misuse or improper variable setup. However, within the given snippet, no specific vulnerability was detected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerability was detected, there are no specific recommendations for this code. However, as a best practice, it's recommended to review the complete code, especially the functions and variables used, to ensure they are correctly declared and implemented to avoid any potential issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
