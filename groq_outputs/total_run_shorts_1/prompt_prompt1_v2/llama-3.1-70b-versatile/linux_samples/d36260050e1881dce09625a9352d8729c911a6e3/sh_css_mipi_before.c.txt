VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 166, 168
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code sample contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `even_line_bytes` for YUV420 formats.

EXPLANATION:
The `even_line_bytes` variable is calculated as `(width_padded * 2 * bits_per_pixel + 7) >> 3`, which shifts the result right by 3 bits to effectively divide by 8. However, the multiplication `width_padded * 2 * bits_per_pixel` can overflow the maximum limit of an `unsigned int` type, especially for larger values of `width_padded` and `bits_per_pixel`. This overflow can result in incorrect values for `even_line_bytes`, potentially leading to incorrect memory allocation or copying.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a larger integer type, such as `uint64_t`, to store the intermediate result of the multiplication before shifting right by 3 bits. Alternatively, you can manually check for overflow conditions before performing the multiplication.

Here is an example of how to modify the calculation to use a larger integer type:
```c
uint64_t temp = (uint64_t)width_padded * 2 * bits_per_pixel;
even_line_bytes = (temp + 7) >> 3;
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
enum ia_css_err
ia_css_mipi_frame_calculate_size(const unsigned int width,
				const unsigned int height,
				const enum ia_css_stream_format format,
				const bool hasSOLandEOL,
				const unsigned int embedded_data_size_words,
				unsigned int *size_mem_words)
{
	/* ... */

	odd_line_bytes = (width_padded * bits_per_pixel + 7) >> 3; /* ceil ( bits per line / 8) */

	/* Even lines for YUV420 formats are double in bits_per_pixel. */
	if (format == IA_CSS_STREAM_FORMAT_YUV420_8
			|| format == IA_CSS_STREAM_FORMAT_YUV420_10
			|| format == IA_CSS_STREAM_FORMAT_YUV420_16) {
		even_line_bytes = (width_padded * 2 * bits_per_pixel + 7) >> 3; /* ceil ( bits per line / 8) */
	} else {
		even_line_bytes = odd_line_bytes;
	}

	/* ... */
