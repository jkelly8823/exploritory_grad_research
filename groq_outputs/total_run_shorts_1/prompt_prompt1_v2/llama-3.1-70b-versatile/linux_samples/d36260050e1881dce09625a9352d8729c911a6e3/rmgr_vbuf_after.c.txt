VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Magic Number Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code utilizes several magic numbers (e.g., `1000`, `32`) without explicitly defining their purpose. These numbers, although harmless on their own, can become liabilities as the code grows and becomes more complex, leading to potential maintenance issues and confusion during debugging. Although not necessarily a security vulnerability in and of itself, this code smell can make security vulnerabilities more difficult to identify and fix by introducing unnecessary complexity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this issue, consider defining named constants to replace these magic numbers. This will make the code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors. For example:

```c
#define MAX_VBUF_HANDLES 1000
#define HMM_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE 32
```
Using named constants will allow developers to quickly understand the purpose of these numbers and facilitate future modifications.

Additionally, make sure to provide a brief description of the purpose of these constants, either through comments or documentation, to further improve maintainability.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 * @brief VBUF resource handles
*/
#define NUM_HANDLES 1000
static struct ia_css_rmgr_vbuf_handle handle_table[NUM_HANDLES];

/*

static struct ia_css_rmgr_vbuf_pool refpool = {
false,			/* copy_on_write */
false,			/* recycle */
0,			/* size */

static struct ia_css_rmgr_vbuf_pool writepool = {
true,			/* copy_on_write */

/*

true,			/* copy_on_write */
true,			/* recycle */
32,			/* size */
0,			/* index */
