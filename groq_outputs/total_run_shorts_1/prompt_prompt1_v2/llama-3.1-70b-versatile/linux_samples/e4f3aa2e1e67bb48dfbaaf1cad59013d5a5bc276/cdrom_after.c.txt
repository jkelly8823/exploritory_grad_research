VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that performs input validation and error handling. The code checks if the `arg` variable is within a valid range and returns an error code if it's not. However, without additional context or variable declarations, the analysis is limited.

A vulnerability is not present because the code snippet:
- Does not contain any network communication or user input reading that could introduce data injection vulnerabilities.
- Performs input validation on the `arg` variable.
- Uses explicit return values to indicate errors.
- Does not contain any dynamic memory allocations or deallocations that could lead to memory-related vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return -ENOSYS;

if (arg != CDSL_CURRENT && arg != CDSL_NONE) {
    if (arg >= cdi->capacity)
        return -EINVAL;
}

/* ... */
```
