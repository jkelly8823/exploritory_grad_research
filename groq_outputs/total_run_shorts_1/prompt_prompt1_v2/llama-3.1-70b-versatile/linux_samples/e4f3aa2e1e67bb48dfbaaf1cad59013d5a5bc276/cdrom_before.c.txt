VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential integer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks if `arg` is within the bounds of `cdi->capacity`. However, the comparison is done between a potentially unsigned value (`arg`) and an integer value (`cdi->capacity`). If `arg` is an unsigned value and its value exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, it will be interpreted as a negative integer value, leading to an incorrect result for the comparison. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass bounds checking.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that both `arg` and `cdi->capacity` are of the same type, or cast `arg` to an integer type that matches the type of `cdi->capacity`. Additionally, consider adding bounds checks for negative values.

For example:

```c
if ((int)arg < 0 || (int)arg >= cdi->capacity)
    return -EINVAL;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return -ENOSYS;

if (arg != CDSL_CURRENT && arg != CDSL_NONE) {
    if ((int)arg >= cdi->capacity)
        return -EINVAL;
}
```
