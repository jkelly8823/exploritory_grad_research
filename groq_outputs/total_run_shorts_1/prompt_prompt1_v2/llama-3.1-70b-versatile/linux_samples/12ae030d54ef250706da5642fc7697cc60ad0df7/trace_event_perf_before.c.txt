VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No known vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a Linux kernel module related to performance event tracing. It checks for specific conditions and returns an error code if the tracing event is restricted to root users or if a certain attribute is not set. No obvious vulnerabilities, such as user-controlled input validation issues, buffer overflows, or missing error checking, were detected in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations for fixes are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
    /* The ftrace function trace is allowed only for root. */
    if (ftrace_event_is_function(tp_event) &&
        perf_paranoid_kernel() && !capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
        return -EPERM;

    /* No tracing, just counting, so no obvious leak */
    if (!(p_event->attr.sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_RAW))
```
