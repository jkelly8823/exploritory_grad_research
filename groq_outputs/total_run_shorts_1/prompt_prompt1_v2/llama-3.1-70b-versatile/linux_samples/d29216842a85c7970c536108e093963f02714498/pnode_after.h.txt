VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability is present in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a set of function declarations in a C header file. None of these functions seem to directly handle any sensitive data or execute potentially hazardous operations based on external input. As a result, I was unable to identify any apparent vulnerabilities in this snippet. However, without access to more code, it's challenging to assess whether or not the behavior of these functions as a whole might introduce security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct mount *copy_tree(struct mount *, struct dentry *, int);
bool is_path_reachable(struct mount *, struct dentry *,
			 const struct path *root);
int count_mounts(struct mnt_namespace *ns, struct mount *mnt);
#endif /* _LINUX_PNODE_H */
