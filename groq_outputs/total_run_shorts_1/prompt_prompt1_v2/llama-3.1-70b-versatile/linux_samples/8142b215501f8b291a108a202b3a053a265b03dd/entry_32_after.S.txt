VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential vulnerability related to indirect function calls has been identified in the code snippet. This vulnerability is known as a "Use After Free" (UAF) or "Indirect Call of a Pointer" vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The potential vulnerability lies in the indirect calls to the `sys_call_table` through the following lines:
```assembly
call *sys_call_table(,%eax,4)  # line 3
call *sys_call_table(,%eax,4)  # line 13
```
In these lines, the program jumps to the addresses stored in the `sys_call_table`, based on the value of `eax`. This type of call can be vulnerable if an attacker has a means to manipulate the values stored in `eax` or `sys_call_table`, thus controlling the flow of the program and executing arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the values stored in `eax` and `sys_call_table` are properly validated and sanitized before indirect calls to prevent code injection.
- Consider using a valid pointer validation mechanism before making indirect calls to prevent exploitation of potential vulnerabilities.
- Refer to secure coding practices and guidelines for mitigating potential vulnerabilities related to indirect function calls.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	cmpl $(NR_syscalls), %eax
	jae sysenter_badsys
	call *sys_call_table(,%eax,4)
sysenter_after_call:
	movl %eax,PT_EAX(%esp)
	LOCKDEP_SYS_EXIT
	DISABLE_INTERRUPTS(CLBR_ANY)
	TRACE_IRQS_OFF
	movl TI_flags(%ebp), %ecx
	jae syscall_badsys
syscall_call:
	call *sys_call_table(,%eax,4)
syscall_after_call:
	movl %eax,PT_EAX(%esp)		# store the return value
syscall_exit:
	LOCKDEP_SYS_EXIT
	DISABLE_INTERRUPTS(CLBR_ANY)	# make sure we don't miss an interrupt
END(syscall_fault)

syscall_badsys:
	movl $-ENOSYS,%eax
	jmp syscall_after_call
END(syscall_badsys)

sysenter_badsys:
	movl $-ENOSYS,%eax
	jmp sysenter_after_call
END(syscall_badsys)
	CFI_ENDPROC
