VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No identified vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a series of function declarations for HCI (Host Controller Interface) device management. The code itself does not contain any actual logic or variables that would indicate the presence of a vulnerability. It's a set of function declarations, and as such, it's not possible to determine the presence of a vulnerability without more context and the implementation details of these functions. However, no major red flags or issues were found in these function declarations themselves.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
