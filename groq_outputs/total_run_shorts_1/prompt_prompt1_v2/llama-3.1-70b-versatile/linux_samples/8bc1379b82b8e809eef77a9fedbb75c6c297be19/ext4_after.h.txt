VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The code appears to be declaring function prototypes for various Ext4-related functions. The functions seem to be designed for manipulating and converting inline data in Ext4 filesystems. There are no signs of insecure data handling, improper memory management, or other common vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are required as the code does not appear to have any vulnerabilities. However, it is essential to note that the security of this code depends on the correct implementation of the functions declared here and the context in which they are used.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct iomap;
extern int ext4_inline_data_iomap(struct inode *inode, struct iomap *iomap);

extern int ext4_inline_data_truncate(struct inode *inode, int *has_inline);

extern int ext4_convert_inline_data(struct inode *inode);
