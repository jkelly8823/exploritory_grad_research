VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a documentation excerpt describing various kernel boot parameters. It does not contain any executable code that could be vulnerable to common programming errors or security threats. The snippet does not have any obvious issues with input validation, buffer management, or user authentication that could be exploited by an attacker. Given the nature of the code, it is not possible to identify any vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are needed in this case, as no vulnerabilities have been detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
fully seed the kernel's CRNG. Default is controlled
by CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU.

randomize_kstack_offset=
[KNL] Enable or disable kernel stack offset
randomization, which provides roughly 5 bits of
entropy, frustrating memory corruption attacks
that depend on stack address determinism or
cross-syscall address exposures. This is only
available on architectures that have defined
CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_RANDOMIZE_KSTACK_OFFSET.
Format: <bool>  (1/Y/y=enable, 0/N/n=disable)
Default is CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_KSTACK_OFFSET_DEFAULT.

ras=option[,option,...] [KNL] RAS-specific options

cec_disable [X86]
Disable the Correctable Errors Collector
