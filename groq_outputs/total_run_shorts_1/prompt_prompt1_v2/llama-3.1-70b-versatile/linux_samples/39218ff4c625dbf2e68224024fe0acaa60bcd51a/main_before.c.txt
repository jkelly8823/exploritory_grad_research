VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No major vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an initialization routine in an operating system, likely Linux-based due to the use of `__init` and `__weak` keywords. The `__weak` keyword is used to define a weak symbol that can be overridden by another definition elsewhere in the code. The `rest_init()` function is likely responsible for initializing the rest of the system. There are no obvious signs of potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string exploitation, or null pointer dereferences.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no recommendations for fixing this code, as no major vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
pti_init();
}

void __init __weak arch_call_rest_init(void)
{
	rest_init();
}
```
