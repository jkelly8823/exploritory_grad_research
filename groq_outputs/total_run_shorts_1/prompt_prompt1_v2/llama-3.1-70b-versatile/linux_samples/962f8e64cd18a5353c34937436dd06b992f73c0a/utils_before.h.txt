VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identifiable vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet includes the declarations of two functions (`perf_event_disable` and `perf_event_reset`) and includes two header files (`<unistd.h>` and `<sys/syscall.h>`) after checking a version condition. No obvious vulnerabilities, such as user input sanitization issues, buffer overflows, data leaks, or integer overflows, were detected.

However, without additional context about the implementation and usage of `perf_event_disable` and `perf_event_reset`, it's difficult to provide a more thorough analysis.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
In order to increase the security and reliability of this code, the following recommendations can be considered:

* Consider adding checks for potential errors returned by `syscall()` when using `perf_event_disable` and `perf_event_reset` functions.
* Verify that `fd` is a valid file descriptor before passing it to `perf_event_disable` and `perf_event_reset`.
* Assuming this code is used to control performance events, use proper locking or synchronization mechanisms if this code is executed in multiple threads or concurrently.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int perf_event_disable(int fd);
int perf_event_reset(int fd);

#if !defined(__GLIBC_PREREQ) || !__GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
