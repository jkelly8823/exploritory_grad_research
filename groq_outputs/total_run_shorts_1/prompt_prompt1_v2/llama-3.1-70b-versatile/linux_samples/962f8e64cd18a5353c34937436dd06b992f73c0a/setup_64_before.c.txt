VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 26-29
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains an insecure assignment of user-controlled input to a sensitive variable rfi_flush.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerable code snippet is located at lines 26-29 within the simpleAttr_rfi_flush attribute, which likely controls the RFI flush functionality through debugfs. Specifically, the issue arises in the rfi_flush_set method, where the input u64 val is directly assigned to a boolean variable enable, with no bounds checking, validation, or sanitization. This can cause an integer overflow and potentially lead to unintended behavior.

However, this assignment alone is not as high of a risk in this specific function as it could be because it is passed a signed long long value from the simple attribute function; there is another potential risk as the variable enable, is a plain boolean. In most cases a bool in C is  actually an int with a domain restricting its use to only '0' and '1'. Assigning out-of-range value directly into a bool is undefined behavior in c.

More serious still, a 64 bit signed integer value is being converted to an int and reduced, this can cause data to be discarded which is lossy.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this vulnerability, we recommend using proper validation, casting and bounds checking. Additionally it is wise to avoid the potential for undefined behavior when writing a value outside of the strict '0', and '1' to a variable of type bool.

It should be assigned a value in a more controlled fashion and ideally ensure input passed falls within a specific 'expectable'  range. Here is an example of a recommended fix:

```c
static int rfi_flush_set(void *data, u64 val)
{
   bool enable;
   if(val == 0 || val == 1){
       enable = (val != 0);
   }else{
       pr_err("rfi_flush: out of range value");
       return -EINVAL;
   }
   ...
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static enum l1d_flush_type enabled_flush_types;
static void *l1d_flush_fallback_area;
static bool no_rfi_flush;
bool rfi_flush;

static int __init handle_no_rfi_flush(char *p)
{
	pr_info("rfi-flush: disabled on command line.");
}
early_param("no_rfi_flush", handle_no_rfi_flush);

/*
 * The RFI flush is not KPTI, but because users will see doco that says to use
 * nopti we hijack that option here to also disable the RFI flush.
 */
	rfi_flush = enable;
}

static void __ref init_fallback_flush(void)
{
	u64 l1d_size, limit;
	int cpu;

	enabled_flush_types = types;

	if (!no_rfi_flush && !cpu_mitigations_off())
		rfi_flush_enable(enable);
}

#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_FS
