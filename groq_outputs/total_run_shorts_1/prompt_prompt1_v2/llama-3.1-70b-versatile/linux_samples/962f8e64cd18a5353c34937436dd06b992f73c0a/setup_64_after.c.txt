VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated input from debugfs file operations

EXPLANATION:
The provided code contains debugfs file operations that allow users to enable or disable certain features by writing 0 or 1 to files like "rfi_flush", "entry_flush", and "uaccess_flush". However, the code that reads the value from these files does not check if the input is 0 or 1. Instead, it directly assigns it to the `enable` variable without validation. This allows an attacker to potentially write arbitrary values to these files, which could result in unexpected behavior.

In the case of the `entry_flush_set`, `uaccess_flush_set`, and `rfi_flush_set` functions, the lack of input validation means that if an attacker writes a value that is neither 0 nor 1, it will cause undefined behavior when trying to enable or disable the feature.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Validate the input from the debugfs file operations. Ensure that the value read from the files is 0 or 1. If the value is not 0 or 1, return an error value to the user.

Example of recommended fixes:

```c
static int entry_flush_set(void *data, u64 val)
{
    bool enable;

    if (val != 0 && val != 1) {
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    enable = (val == 1);
    if (enable != entry_flush)
        entry_flush_enable(enable);

    return 0;
}
```

Apply this validation to all `set` functions for the debugfs file operations.

ORIGINAL CODE:

As above.
