VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Lines 13-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code introduces a vulnerability due to the use of functions with externally controlled inputs without proper validation. 

EXPLANATION: 
In lines 13-14, `fwnmi_init()` and `setup_rfi_flush()` (indirectly via `pseries_setup_rfi_flush()`) are called in an uncontrolled way from an enumeration `rtas_iov_fw_value_map`. Enumerations typically serve as a set of distinct values; however, it appears that functions are being used instead. Without the declaration of `fwnmi_init()` and `setup_rfi_flush()` in this context, it is possible that these functions' parameters or execution is controlled by an external source.

This could introduce an arbitrary code execution vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate these parameters, functions, or the `rtas_iov_fw_value_map` enumeration to make function calls with untrusted or malicious inputs.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Check if `fwnmi_init()` and `setup_rfi_flush()` functions are intended to be executed from within the enumeration.
- Validate the parameters or inputs to the functions to ensure they are properly sanitized.
- Consider rewriting the code to follow conventional uses of enumerations.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
security_ftr_clear(SEC_FTR_BNDS_CHK_SPEC_BAR);
}

void pseries_setup_rfi_flush(void)
{
struct h_cpu_char_result result;
enum l1d_flush_type types;
bool enable;

setup_rfi_flush(types, enable);
setup_count_cache_flush();
}

#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_IOV
enum rtas_iov_fw_value_map {

fwnmi_init();

pseries_setup_rfi_flush();
setup_stf_barrier();
pseries_lpar_read_hblkrm_characteristics();

/* By default, only probe PCI (can be overridden by rtas_pci) */
pci_add_flags(PCI_PROBE_ONLY);
```
