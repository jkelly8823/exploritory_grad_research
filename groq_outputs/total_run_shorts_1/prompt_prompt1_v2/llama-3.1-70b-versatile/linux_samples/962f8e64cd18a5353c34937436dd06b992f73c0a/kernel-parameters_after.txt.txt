VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a collection of Linux kernel boot parameters. These parameters are used to configure the behavior of the kernel during boot. After analyzing the code, I did not find any apparent vulnerabilities or suspicious code. All lines of code appear to be valid and safe kernel boot parameters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary, as none were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
					       mds=off [X86]
					       tsx_async_abort=off [X86]
					       kvm.nx_huge_pages=off [X86]
					       no_entry_flush [PPC]
					       no_uaccess_flush [PPC]

				Exceptions:
					       This does not have any effect on
					       kvm.nx_huge_pages when

	noefi		Disable EFI runtime services support.

	no_entry_flush  [PPC] Don't flush the L1-D cache when entering the kernel.

	noexec		[IA-64]

	noexec		[X86]
			On X86-32 available only on PAE configured kernels.
	nospec_store_bypass_disable
			[HW] Disable all mitigations for the Speculative Store Bypass vulnerability

	no_uaccess_flush
	                [PPC] Don't flush the L1-D cache after accessing user data.

	noxsave		[BUGS=X86] Disables x86 extended register state save
			and restore using xsave. The kernel will fallback to
			enabling legacy floating-point and sse state.
