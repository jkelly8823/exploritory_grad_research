VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. The code appears to be function declarations for `perf_event_disable` and `perf_event_reset`, and a struct definition for `perf_event_read`. The code also includes conditional includes for `unistd.h` and `sys/syscall.h` based on the version of glibc. The imports seem standard, and the type of vulnerability that would apply is either an incorrect usage of a standard function or the usage itself of a vulnerable library. This isn't applicable to this provided code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int perf_event_disable(int fd);
int perf_event_reset(int fd);

struct perf_event_read {
	__u64 nr;
	__u64 l1d_misses;
};

#if !defined(__GLIBC_PREREQ) || !__GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
