VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Use of a generic error number in error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet assigns a generic error number (`-ENXIO`) to the `err` variable in case an error occurs, and then returns this value. This practice obscures the true reason for the error and makes debugging more challenging. Additionally, it might allow an attacker to exploit the situation by providing misleading error information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this issue, it is recommended to handle specific error cases and return more informative error codes or messages. This will improve error handling and debugging capabilities. Consider using error codes that are more specific to the particular error that occurred.

One possible way to improve this code is to use the actual error code returned by the failed operation. For example:

```c
int error_code = snd_pcm_info_user(substream, info);
if (error_code < 0) {
    err = error_code;
    goto _error;
}
```

However, without the complete context and surrounding code, it is hard to provide a definitive solution. Always attempt to return error codes that accurately describe the error.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
            err = -ENXIO;
            goto _error;
        }
        err = snd_pcm_info_user(substream, info);
    _error:
        mutex_unlock(&register_mutex);
        return err;
    }
```
