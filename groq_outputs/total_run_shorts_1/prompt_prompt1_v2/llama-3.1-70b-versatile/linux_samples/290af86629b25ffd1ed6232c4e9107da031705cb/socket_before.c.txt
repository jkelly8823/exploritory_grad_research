VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an initialization routine for the socket module in the Linux kernel. It registers a function to be executed during early initialization and defines a function to display socket information in the /proc file system, if the CONFIG_PROC_FS configuration option is enabled.

Based on the provided snippet, no potential security vulnerabilities can be identified. However, without access to the full codebase, further analysis would be needed to ensure that this code does not contribute to any larger security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None applicable, as no vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
core_initcall(sock_init);	/* early initcall */

#ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS
void socket_seq_show(struct seq_file *seq)
{
	int cpu;
