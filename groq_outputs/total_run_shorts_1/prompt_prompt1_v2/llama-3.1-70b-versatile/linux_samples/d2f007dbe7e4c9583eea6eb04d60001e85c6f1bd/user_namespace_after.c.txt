VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow due to unchecked buffer size.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `new_map.nr_extents` is used as the number of elements to copy from `new_map.extent` to `map->extent` without properly checking if it exceeds the destination buffer size. This can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the `map->extent` array, potentially causing memory corruption and unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that `new_map.nr_extents` does not exceed the size of the destination buffer. You can achieve this by adding a bounds check before the memcpy call. For example:

```c
if (new_map.nr_extents <= UID_GID_MAP_MAX_BASE_EXTENTS) {
    size_t max_copy_size = min(new_map.nr_extents, UID_GID_MAP_MAX_BASE_EXTENTS);
    memcpy(map->extent, new_map.extent, max_copy_size * sizeof(new_map.extent[0]));
}
```
Alternatively, consider using `memmove` or `memcpy_s` which can handle buffer overflow more safely.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (!new_idmap_permitted(file, ns, cap_setid, &new_map))
    goto out;

ret = -EPERM;
/* Map the lower ids from the parent user namespace to the
 * kernel global id space.
 */
    e->lower_first = lower_first;
}

/*
 * If we want to use binary search for lookup, this clones the extent
 * array and sorts both copies.
 */
ret = sort_idmaps(&new_map);
if (ret < 0)
    goto out;

/* Install the map */
if (new_map.nr_extents <= UID_GID_MAP_MAX_BASE_EXTENTS) {
    memcpy(map->extent, new_map.extent,
           new_map.nr_extents * sizeof(new_map.extent[0]));
```
