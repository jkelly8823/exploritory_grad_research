VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when using the `memcpy` function. Specifically, the lines `memcpy(bss_entry->ssid.ssid, (current_ptr + 2), element_len);` and `memcpy(bss_entry->data_rates, current_ptr + 2, element_len);` and `memcpy(bss_entry->supported_rates, current_ptr + 2, element_len);` are not checking the bounds of the target buffers before copying data into them. 

While the code does check if `element_len` exceeds `IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN` and `MWIFIEX_SUPPORTED_RATES`, it does not account for the size of the target buffers or their available capacity. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `element_len` is larger than the target buffers.

Additionally, for the case of `WLAN_EID_SUPP_RATES`, it's unclear if both `bss_entry->data_rates` and `bss_entry->supported_rates` have the same capacity. Copying the same data into both without checking their respective capacities can also lead to a buffer overflow if their capacities differ.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the capacity of the target buffers before copying data into them. This can be achieved by:

* Verifying that the target buffers are null-terminated and the `element_len` does not exceed their capacity.
* Using safer copying functions like `strncpy` for strings or `memcpy_s` with the correct buffer sizes.
* Verifying the capacities of `bss_entry->data_rates` and `bss_entry->supported_rates` and copying the data accordingly if they differ.
