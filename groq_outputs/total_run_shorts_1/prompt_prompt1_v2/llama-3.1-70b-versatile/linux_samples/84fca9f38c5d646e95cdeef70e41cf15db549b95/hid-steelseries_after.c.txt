VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Error Handling - Unchecked Return Values

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet demonstrates potential insecure error handling practices. Upon calling `hid_hw_start(hdev, HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT)`, the function's return value is checked, but only against true (non-zero value). However, in error handling practices, it's crucial to verify if an error actually occurred or if the function call was successful. 

A potential security vulnerability arises if a function call has multiple possible error return values, such as hardware or software errors. 

If the implementation of `hid_hw_start` is insecure or doesn't properly handle errors, this code might not catch every possible error scenario and may lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes.

However, in this specific code snippet, given the use of specific error-checking afterwards, this vulnerability may be low-severity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To enhance error handling and improve code security:
1. Carefully review the return values' documentation for `hid_hw_start` to cover all potential error cases. For example, some functions may return both positive and negative integer values to indicate different types of errors.
2. Use explicit comparisons to check for success/failure or use errno instead of bare return values when functions have complex error handling.

ORIGINAL CODE:
		goto err_free;
	}

	if (!hid_validate_values(hdev, HID_OUTPUT_REPORT, 0, 0, 16)) {
		ret = -ENODEV;
		goto err_free;
	}

	ret = hid_hw_start(hdev, HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT);
	if (ret) {
		hid_err(hdev, "hw start failed\n");
		goto err_free;
