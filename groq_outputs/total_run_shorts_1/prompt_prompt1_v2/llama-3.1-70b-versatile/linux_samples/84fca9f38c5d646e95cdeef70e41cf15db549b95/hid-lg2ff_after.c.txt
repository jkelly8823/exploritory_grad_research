VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory leak due to missing resource deallocation on error path

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet allocates memory for `lg2ff_device` using `kmalloc`. However, if the allocation fails, an error is returned but the previously allocated memory (`report`) is not deallocated. This can lead to a memory leak in the case of repeated failed allocations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add a `kfree` call to deallocate the `report` memory before returning an error. Here's how the corrected code could look like:
```c
struct hid_report *report;
struct hid_input *hidinput = list_entry(hid->inputs.next,
						struct hid_input, list);
struct input_dev *dev = hidinput->input;
int error;

	/* Check that the report looks ok */
	report = hid_validate_values(hid, HID_OUTPUT_REPORT, 0, 0, 7);
	if (!report)
		return -ENODEV;

	lg2ff = kmalloc(sizeof(struct lg2ff_device), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!lg2ff) {
		kfree(report);  // Deallocate report memory on error
		return -ENOMEM;
	}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
(struct hid_report *report;
struct hid_input *hidinput = list_entry(hid->inputs.next,
						struct hid_input, list);
struct input_dev *dev = hidinput->input;
int error;

	/* Check that the report looks ok */
report = hid_validate_values(hid, HID_OUTPUT_REPORT, 0, 0, 7);
if (!report)
	return -ENODEV;

lg2ff = kmalloc(sizeof(struct lg2ff_device), GFP_KERNEL);
if (!lg2ff)
	return -ENOMEM;)
