VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13, 28, 30
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerabilities are present due to insufficient validation of user input data.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be part of a HID (Human Interface Device) driver. It processes reports from a multitouch device and updates certain values accordingly. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the data from the input report (i.e., `field->value[0]`, `usage->usage_index`, and `field->index`) is not thoroughly validated before being used to update internal state variables.

On lines 13 and 28, there is no validation of the `field->value[0]` and `usage->usage_index` values before assigning them to `td->maxcontacts` and `td->cc_index`, respectively. An attacker with control over the input device could potentially send reports with malicious values, resulting in an IDOR.

On line 30, an uncontrolled recursion might occur as `mt_store_field` is called without any validation.
