VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, it appears to be a part of a larger program that handles different types of eBPF programs. The code snippet appears to be handling different BPF program types, including LIRC mode 2. The code checks for specific BPF program types and performs the corresponding actions.

The code snippet seems to be properly handling potential errors and is not performing any operations that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or information disclosure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, there are no recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities in this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
case BPF_LIRC_MODE2:
	ptype = BPF_PROG_TYPE_LIRC_MODE2;
	break;
default:
	return -EINVAL;
}

case BPF_PROG_TYPE_LIRC_MODE2:
	ret = lirc_prog_attach(attr, prog);
	break;
default:
	ret = cgroup_bpf_prog_attach(attr, ptype, prog);
}

return sockmap_get_from_fd(attr, BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_SKB, NULL);
case BPF_LIRC_MODE2:
	return lirc_prog_detach(attr);
default:
	return -EINVAL;
}
