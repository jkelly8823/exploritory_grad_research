VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a snippet of a C code that defines an array of enum values and a function prototype. There is no apparent memory allocation or data copying operations in this code that could lead to common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. The function print_boot_time has two parameters (nsecs and size) that, while not having clear bounds, appear to be passed values that would eventually be validated elsewhere in the full codebase, so they do not present an immediate vulnerability here.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None are immediately apparent in this snippet. However, it would be a good idea to ensure that the function print_boot_time is carefully validating the input values for nsecs and size and handling any potential overflows that could occur within this function.

ORIGINAL CODE:

  [BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT]	= "raw_tracepoint",
  [BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR] = "cgroup_sock_addr",
  [BPF_PROG_TYPE_LIRC_MODE2]	= "lirc_mode2",
};
