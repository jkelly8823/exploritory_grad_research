VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be defining BPF program and map types. It does not perform any user input validation, data processing, or system calls that could introduce a vulnerability. The code also does not indicate any potential misuse of unsafe functions or data types that could lead to a vulnerability.

The use of preprocessor directives (`#ifdef`) suggests that the code is using conditional compilation to select specific code paths based on configuration options. However, this is a standard and safe practice in C programming.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet as it does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities.
