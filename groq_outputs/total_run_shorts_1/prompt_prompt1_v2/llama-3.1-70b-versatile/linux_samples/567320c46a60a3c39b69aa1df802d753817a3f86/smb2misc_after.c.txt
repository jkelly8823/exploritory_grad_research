VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code does not properly validate the structure size of SMB2 responses, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate or access sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks for a valid SMB2 command using `smb2_rsp_struct_sizes[command]`. However, prior to this check, it does not adequately validate the `StructureSize2` field in the SMB2 response. The code only checks if the `StructureSize2` matches the expected value, but does not validate if the length of the data provided (`len`) is less than the structure size. This could lead to a read out-of-bounds, which is particularly concerning given the `Status` flag check and potential error handling paths that follow this logic. While line 26 does check the status, it does not prevent the potential vulnerability before it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate `StructureSize2` before using it.
2. Check `len` is at least `StructureSize2` before processing the SMB2 response to prevent potential out-of-bounds reads.
3. Consider implementing input validation for all data coming from external sources, to prevent similar issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c

mid = le64_to_cpu(shdr->MessageId);
if (check_smb2_hdr(shdr, mid))
	return 1;

if (shdr->StructureSize != SMB2_HEADER_STRUCTURE_SIZE) {
	cifs_dbg(VFS, "Invalid structure size %u\n",
		 le16_to_cpu(shdr->StructureSize));
	return 1;
}

command = le16_to_cpu(shdr->Command);
if (command >= NUMBER_OF_SMB2_COMMANDS) {
	cifs_dbg(VFS, "Invalid SMB2 command %d\n", command);
	return 1;
}

if (len < pdu_size) {
	if ((len >= hdr_size)
	    && (shdr->Status != 0)) {
		pdu->StructureSize2 = 0;
	return 1;
}

if (smb2_rsp_struct_sizes[command] != pdu->StructureSize2) {
	if (command != SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK_HE && (shdr->Status == 0 ||
	    pdu->StructureSize2 != SMB2_ERROR_STRUCTURE_SIZE2_LE)) {
		/* error packets have 9 byte structure size */
