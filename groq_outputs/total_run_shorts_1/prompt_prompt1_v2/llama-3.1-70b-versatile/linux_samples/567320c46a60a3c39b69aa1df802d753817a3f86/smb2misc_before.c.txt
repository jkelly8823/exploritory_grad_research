VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbounded integer comparisons and missing error checking for SMB2 Commands

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the inputs to the comparisons involving `shdr->StructureSize`, `command`, and `pdu->StructureSize2` may be under attacker control, causing potential vulnerabilities related to unbounded integer comparisons. 

Moreover, although `smb2_rsp_struct_sizes` is used for validating the `StructureSize2` of different SMB2 commands, it does not appear to provide any protection against missing commands past the end of the array. Since it checks if `command >= NUMBER_OF_SMB2_COMMANDS`, an attacker could potentially send an SMB2 command greater than or equal to `NUMBER_OF_SMB2_COMMANDS`, which might bypass this validation or can be interpreted as a negative index causing out of bound access.

Additionally, SMB2 commands such as `SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK_HE` could result in inconsistent `StructureSize2` which could also lead to undefined behavior or potential vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement robust error checking on all SMB2 commands, preferably at the start of the method, including check of bounds for `smb2_rsp_struct_sizes`. 
2. To handle error cases properly or unexpected SMB2 commands that might not have corresponding `StructureSize2`, define behavior of handling unexpected SMB2 commands to prevent unforeseen access as the rest of the logic unfolds. 
3. Perform strong validation on any other SMB2 commands with structure sizes variations (such as SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK_HE) and, validate input length for these inputs.
4. Bounds checking should be added on len while verifying `pdu_size`, `hdr_size` prior using.
