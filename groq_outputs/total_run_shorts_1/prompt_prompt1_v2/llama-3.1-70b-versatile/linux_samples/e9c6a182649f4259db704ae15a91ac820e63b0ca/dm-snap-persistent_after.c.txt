VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer overflow vulnerability in memory allocation.

EXPLANATION:
In the `get_info` function, the variable `size` is checked against the expression `((ps->next_free + 1) * store->chunk_size)`. However, the multiplication operation can potentially overflow if `ps->next_free` is large and `store->chunk_size` is also large. This could lead to a situation where the check incorrectly passes, potentially allowing the allocation of more memory than is actually available.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform the multiplication operation using a type that can handle larger values, and it should also check for potential overflow before performing the multiplication. Here is a possible fix:

```c
sector_t required_size = ps->next_free + 1;
sector_t chunk_size = store->chunk_size;

if (sector_div_overflow(required_size, chunk_size, &required_size) != 0) {
    // Handle the overflow error
} else if (size < required_size) {
    // Move onto the next free pending, making sure to take
    // into account the location of the metadata chunks.
    ps->next_free++;
    skip_metadata(ps);

    atomic_inc(&ps->pending_count);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return NUM_SNAPSHOT_HDR_CHUNKS + ((ps->exceptions_per_area + 1) * area);
}

static void skip_metadata(struct pstore *ps)
{
uint32_t stride = ps->exceptions_per_area + 1;
chunk_t next_free = ps->next_free;
if (sector_div(next_free, stride) == NUM_SNAPSHOT_HDR_CHUNKS)
ps->next_free++;
}

/*
* Read or write a metadata area.  Remembering to skip the first
* chunk which holds the header.
*/

ps->current_area--;

skip_metadata(ps);

return 0;
}

static struct pstore *get_info(struct dm_exception_store *store)
struct dm_exception *e)
{
struct pstore *ps = get_info(store);
sector_t size = get_dev_size(dm_snap_cow(store->snap)->bdev);

/* Is there enough room ? */
if (size < ((ps->next_free + 1) * store->chunk_size))
* Move onto the next free pending, making sure to take
* into account the location of the metadata chunks.
*/
ps->next_free++;
skip_metadata(ps);

atomic_inc(&ps->pending_count);
return 0;
}
```

Note that there might be other security concerns in this code that are not related to integer overflows, but this is the most obvious one in this snippet.
