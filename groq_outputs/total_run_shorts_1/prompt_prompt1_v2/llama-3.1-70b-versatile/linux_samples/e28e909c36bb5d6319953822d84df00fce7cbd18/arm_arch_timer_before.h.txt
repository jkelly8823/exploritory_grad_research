VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities have been identified in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is written in C and appears to be part of a Linux kernel module, specifically dealing with kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) timers. It includes function prototypes and a struct definition. Upon analyzing the provided code snippet, no potential security vulnerabilities have been detected. There are no user input, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, or system call invocations in the given code, which makes it unlikely to be vulnerable to common security threats.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/workqueue.h>

struct arch_timer_kvm {
	/* Is the timer enabled */
	bool			enabled;

	/* Virtual offset */
	cycle_t			cntvoff;
};

	/* Timer IRQ */
	struct kvm_irq_level		irq;

	/* VGIC mapping */
	struct irq_phys_map		*map;

	/* Active IRQ state caching */
	bool				active_cleared_last;
};

int kvm_timer_hyp_init(void);
void kvm_timer_enable(struct kvm *kvm);
void kvm_timer_init(struct kvm *kvm);
int kvm_timer_vcpu_reset(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,
			 const struct kvm_irq_level *irq);
void kvm_timer_vcpu_init(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu);
