VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
After reviewing the provided code snippet, no vulnerabilities were identified. The code defines a series of constants for GICv2 emulation and seems to be correctly implemented without any potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define ICH_LR_ACTIVE_BIT		(1ULL << 63)
#define ICH_LR_PHYS_ID_SHIFT		32
#define ICH_LR_PHYS_ID_MASK		(0x3ffULL << ICH_LR_PHYS_ID_SHIFT)
#define ICH_LR_PRIORITY_SHIFT		48

/* These are for GICv2 emulation only */
#define GICH_LR_VIRTUALID		(0x3ffUL << 0)
#define GICH_LR_PHYSID_CPUID_SHIFT	(10)
#define GICH_LR_PHYSID_CPUID		(7UL << GICH_LR_PHYSID_CPUID_SHIFT)

#define ICH_MISR_EOI			(1 << 0)
#define ICH_MISR_U			(1 << 1)
