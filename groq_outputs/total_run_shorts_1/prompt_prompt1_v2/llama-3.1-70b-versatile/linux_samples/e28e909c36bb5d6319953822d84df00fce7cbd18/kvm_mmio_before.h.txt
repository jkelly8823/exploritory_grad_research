VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation, and it consists of two function declarations. There is no potential vulnerability in these lines as they are only declarations and do not perform any operations that can lead to a vulnerability.

The first function, `kvm_handle_mmio_return`, seems to handle a return from an MMIO (Memory-Mapped I/O) operation in the context of a KVM virtual CPU. The second function, `io_mem_abort`, appears to handle an abort in an I/O memory access.

Since there is no actual code that performs any operation, there is no potential vulnerability in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
bool sign_extend;
};

int kvm_handle_mmio_return(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct kvm_run *run);
int io_mem_abort(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct kvm_run *run,
		 phys_addr_t fault_ipa);
```
