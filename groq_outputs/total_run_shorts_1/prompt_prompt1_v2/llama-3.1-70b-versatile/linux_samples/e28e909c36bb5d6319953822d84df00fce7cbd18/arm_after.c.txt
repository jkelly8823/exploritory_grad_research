VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet appears to be free from obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: I have thoroughly reviewed the provided code snippet and found no evident vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or input validation issues. However, it's essential to consider that this evaluation is limited to the given snippet and might not represent the entire codebase. Additionally, the absence of variable declarations and import statements makes it challenging to assess some aspects of the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Since no vulnerabilities were identified, no recommendations are provided. It is essential to continue monitoring the codebase for potential vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to secure coding practices.
