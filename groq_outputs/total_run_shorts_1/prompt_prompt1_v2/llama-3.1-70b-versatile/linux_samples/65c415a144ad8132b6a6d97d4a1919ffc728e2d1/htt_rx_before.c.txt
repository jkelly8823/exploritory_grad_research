VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16-17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability in this code snippet is a resource leak due to a missing NULL pointer check after freeing memory using dev_kfree_skb_any. 

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the msdu pointer is freed using dev_kfree_skb_any. However, after freeing the memory, the pointer is still used in the next line of code where it is assigned to temp. 
Additionally, there are several other uses of the freed msdu pointer in the code snippet (e.g., in the continue statement). This can cause a use-after-free error, potentially leading to a segmentation fault or unexpected behavior. 

This vulnerability occurs because the msdu pointer is not set to NULL after it is freed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the msdu pointer should be set to NULL after it is freed to prevent any further use of the freed memory. Here is the recommended fix:

 	if (!frag_pn_check) {
		/* Discard the fragment with invalid PN */
		temp = msdu->prev;
		__skb_unlink(msdu, amsdu);
		dev_kfree_skb_any(msdu);
		msdu = NULL;  // Set msdu to NULL to prevent use-after-free
		frag_pn_check = true;
		continue;
	}

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return pn;
}

static bool ath10k_htt_rx_h_frag_pn_check(struct ath10k *ar,
					  struct sk_buff *skb,
					  u16 peer_id,
					  u16 offset,
	bool is_decrypted;
	bool is_mgmt;
	u32 attention;
	bool frag_pn_check = true;

	if (skb_queue_empty(amsdu))
		return;

								      0,
								      enctype);

		if (!frag_pn_check) {
			/* Discard the fragment with invalid PN */
			temp = msdu->prev;
			__skb_unlink(msdu, amsdu);
			dev_kfree_skb_any(msdu);
			msdu = temp;
			frag_pn_check = true;
			continue;
		}

		ath10k_htt_rx_h_csum_offload(msdu);
