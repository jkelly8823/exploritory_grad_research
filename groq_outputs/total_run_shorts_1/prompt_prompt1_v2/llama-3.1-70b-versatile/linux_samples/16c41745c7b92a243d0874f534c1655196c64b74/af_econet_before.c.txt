VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double Free Vulnerability, Use After Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, memory is allocated using `kzalloc` and assigned to `edev`. However, the code does not check if the allocation was successful. `kzalloc` can return a null pointer if the allocation failed. But even more critical is that `edev` is assigned a new value after it is assigned from another source, `dev->ec_ptr`. This previous `dev->ec_ptr` is never checked to see if the memory has been freed.
If `dev->ec_ptr` points to the same location that the new memory is being written to (from the `kzalloc`), and this memory was previously allocated, then this previous location can be the result of a double free situation. Additionally, if the memory pointed to by `dev->ec_ptr` has already been freed, this can result in a use after free situation.

The control flow where `dev->ec_ptr` points to `NULL` before it is "reassigned" to a new allocation can help to mitigate such bad behavior. But if it points to non `NULL` this behavior will likely happen.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent Double Free Vulnerability and Use After Free Vulnerability, it is necessary to:
- Always check if the memory allocation was successful
- Free the old memory if `edev` is not null before it can be reassigned to point at new allocation
Here is an example:

```c
err = 0;
switch (cmd) {
case SIOCSIFADDR:
	edev = dev->ec_ptr;
	if (edev != NULL) {
		/* Free old allocation */
		kfree(edev);
		edev = dev->ec_ptr = NULL; // assign back to NULL
	}
	/* No more magic. Allocate only when really needed. */
	edev = dev->ec_ptr = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ec_device), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (edev == NULL) {
		/* Handle memory allocation failure */
	}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
err = 0;
switch (cmd) {
case SIOCSIFADDR:
	edev = dev->ec_ptr;
	if (edev == NULL) {
		/* Magic up a new one. */
		edev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ec_device), GFP_KERNEL);
```
