VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of an unchecked memcpy function.


EXPLANATION:
The memcpy function is used to copy memory from one location to another. It relies on the user to provide the correct size of the destination buffer. However, this code snippet does not check whether the destination buffer 'to' is large enough to hold 'n' bytes of data. If 'to' is not large enough, this could cause a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.


Additionally, the use of 'n' as the size parameter without checking its value could lead to another type of vulnerability if 'n' is an untrusted input. If 'n' is negative or extremely large, it could also lead to a buffer overflow or other unexpected behavior.


The __memcpy3d and __memcpy functions may implement additional checks or handling for these issues, but this information is not provided in the given snippet and cannot be determined from this code alone.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following steps should be taken:
- Verify that the destination buffer 'to' is large enough to hold 'n' bytes of data before calling memcpy.
- Check the value of 'n' to ensure it is a reasonable and trusted value.
- Use memory-safe alternatives to memcpy, such as memmove or memcpy_s, which provide additional checks and handling for potential buffer overflows.


The following code demonstrates how to check the size of the destination buffer and use memcpy_safe (a hypothetical function):
```c
__visible void *memcpy(void *to, const void *from, size_t n, size_t to_size)
{
    if (n > to_size) {
        // Handle error: Destination buffer is too small.
        return NULL;
    }
    return memcpy_safe(to, from, n);
}
```
But, this code should be adjusted according to your project's overall needs and requirements.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
__visible void *memcpy(void *to, const void *from, size_t n)
{
#if defined(CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW) && !defined(CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE)
	return __memcpy3d(to, from, n);
#else
	return __memcpy(to, from, n);
#endif
