VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability has been found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a C function that exports symbols for the Linux kernel. The `strreplace` function seems to be returning a string `s`, and the `fortify_panic` function handles a buffer overflow by printing an error message and triggering a kernel panic. No obvious vulnerabilities such as user input validation, improper null checks, or potential path traversal issues were found.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return s;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(strreplace);

void fortify_panic(const char *name)
{
    pr_emerg("detected buffer overflow in %s\n", name);
    BUG();
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(fortify_panic);
```
