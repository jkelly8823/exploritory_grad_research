VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `fortify_panic` function only handles buffer overflow detection, and panics with an error message that is not parameterizable. However, it receives a `name` parameter that is not used. This indicates potential incomplete error handling.
EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, the `fortify_panic` function takes a `name` parameter but does not use it. This parameter likely corresponds to the name of the function or the component that triggered the panic. Not using this information may hinder error diagnosis or analysis if a panic occurs, potentially reducing the effectiveness of incident response and possibly misdirecting investigations.

In addition, there is no indication in the `fortify_panic` function whether it will attempt to deallocate or unwind stack- or heap-based resources, which could further exacerbate the panic.

However, the primary concern here is the unused `name` parameter indicating unparameterized panic behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Modify the `fortify_panic` function to incorporate the `name` parameter into its error handling and panic behavior. Ideally, the error message should include the `name` of the entity that triggered the panic to better identify the source of the error.

```c
void fortify_panic(const char *name)
{
    error("%s detected buffer overflow", name);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
debug_putstr("done.\nBooting the kernel.\n");
return output;
}

void fortify_panic(const char *name)
{
error("detected buffer overflow");
}
```
