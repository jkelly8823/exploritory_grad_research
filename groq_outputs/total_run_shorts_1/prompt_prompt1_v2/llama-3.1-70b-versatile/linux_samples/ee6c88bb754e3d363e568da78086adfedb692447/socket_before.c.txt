VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The memcpy function is used without bounds checking, potentially allowing a buffer overflow if the size of the 'prim->ipaddr' is larger than the size of 'struct sockaddr_storage'.

EXPLANATION:
The 'memcpy' function does not perform any bounds checking on its arguments. The 'sizeof' function is used to specify the number of bytes to copy, but if the structure of 'prim->ipaddr' is not identical to 'struct sockaddr_storage', a buffer overflow or underflow may occur, potentially overwriting nearby memory or accessing memory outside the bounds of the structure. In addition, the subsequent assignments of 'info->sctpi_p_state', 'info->sctpi_p_cwnd', 'info->sctpi_p_srtt', and 'info->sctpi_p_rto' do not check whether the 'prim' pointer is NULL before accessing its members, potentially causing null pointer dereferences.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like 'memcpy_s' if available, or ensure that the size of 'prim->ipaddr' is identical to 'struct sockaddr_storage' to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Check whether the 'prim' pointer is NULL before accessing its members to prevent null pointer dereferences.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
    info->sctpi_ictrlchunks = asoc->stats.ictrlchunks;

    prim = asoc->peer.primary_path;
    memcpy(&info->sctpi_p_address, &prim->ipaddr,
           sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage));
    info->sctpi_p_state = prim->state;
    info->sctpi_p_cwnd = prim->cwnd;
    info->sctpi_p_srtt = prim->srtt;
    info->sctpi_p_rto = jiffies_to_msecs(prim->rto);
```
