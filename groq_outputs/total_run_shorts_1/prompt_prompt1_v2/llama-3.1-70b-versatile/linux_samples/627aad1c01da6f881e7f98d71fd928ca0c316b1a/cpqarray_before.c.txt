VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Disclosure Vulnerability due to Unsanitize User Mode Pointer

EXPLANATION:
The `copy_to_user` function is used to copy data from the kernel to a user-mode buffer. However, the pointer provided as the first argument to `copy_to_user` is not being sanitized or validated to ensure it is a valid, non-null, user-mode pointer. This could potentially lead to an information disclosure vulnerability if the provided pointer points to kernel memory.

Additionally, there is an implicit assumption that the pointer `arg` is a valid user-mode pointer. However, the code doesn't perform any checks to validate this assumption. This could lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or information disclosure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Before copying data to the user-mode buffer, validate the `arg` pointer to ensure it is a valid user-mode address using `access_ok` and `VERIFY_READ`. 
2. Consider using `put_user` functions for simple operations to reduce complexity and risks.

Here's an example of the recommended validation:
```c
if (!access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, arg, sizeof(ida_pci_info_struct))) {
    return -EFAULT;
}
...
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
ida_pci_info_struct pciinfo;

if (!arg) return -EINVAL;
pciinfo.bus = host->pci_dev->bus->number;
pciinfo.dev_fn = host->pci_dev->devfn;
pciinfo.board_id = host->board_id;
if (copy_to_user((void __user *) arg, &pciinfo,
