VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Unhandled incomplete leap year logic, which may lead to incorrect date calculations.

EXPLANATION:
 The provided code snippet appears to be handling date and time validation, as well as leap year logic. However, in the leap year logic section (lines 13-15), there is a conditional statement with an empty block. This suggests that the leap year logic is not properly handled for years that are exactly divisible by 100 but not by 400. This is a potential vulnerability because it could lead to incorrect date calculations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 To fix the vulnerability, you should update the leap year logic to correctly handle years that are exactly divisible by 100 but not by 400. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check for years that are exactly divisible by 400, and adjusting the `mon_len` value accordingly.

```c
if (mon == 2) {
    if (year % 4 == 0) {
        mon_len = 29;
        if (year % 100 == 0) {
            if (year % 400 == 0) {
                // leave mon_len as 29
            } else {
                mon_len = 28;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (*p != 'Z')
    goto unsupported_time;

if (year < 1970 ||
    mon < 1 || mon > 12)
    goto invalid_time;

mon_len = month_lengths[mon - 1];
if (mon == 2) {
    if (year % 4 == 0) {
        mon_len = 29;
        if (year % 100 == 0) {
    }
}

if (day < 1 || day > mon_len ||
    hour > 23 ||
    min > 59 ||
    sec > 59)
    goto invalid_time;

*_t = mktime64(year, mon, day, hour, min, sec);
return 0;
