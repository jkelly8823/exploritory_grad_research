VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of function declarations for various capability checking and auditing functions in a Linux kernel context. There are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this code, as it primarily defines function prototypes without any implementation.

No security risks or potential issues are identified within this snippet, likely because it only includes function declarations without actual logic or data manipulation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and safe to use as-is.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct user_namespace *ns, int cap);
extern bool capable(int cap);
extern bool ns_capable(struct user_namespace *ns, int cap);
extern bool capable_wrt_inode_uidgid(const struct inode *inode, int cap);
extern bool file_ns_capable(const struct file *file, struct user_namespace *ns, int cap);

/* audit system wants to get cap info from files as well */
extern int get_vfs_caps_from_disk(const struct dentry *dentry, struct cpu_vfs_cap_data *cpu_caps);
