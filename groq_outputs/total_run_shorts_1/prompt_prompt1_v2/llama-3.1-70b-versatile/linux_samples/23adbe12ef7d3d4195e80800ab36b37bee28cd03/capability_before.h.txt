VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet is a set of function declarations dealing with capability-based security. No implementation or usage of these functions is shown, and there are no apparent vulnerabilities.

This code defines several functions to check and retrieve capability information. The functions and declarations themselves do not pose any security risks, as they are interface definitions rather than actual code with potentially vulnerable behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct user_namespace *ns, int cap);
extern bool capable(int cap);
extern bool ns_capable(struct user_namespace *ns, int cap);
extern bool inode_capable(const struct inode *inode, int cap);
extern bool file_ns_capable(const struct file *file, struct user_namespace *ns, int cap);

/* audit system wants to get cap info from files as well */
extern int get_vfs_caps_from_disk(const struct dentry *dentry, struct cpu_vfs_cap_data *cpu_caps);
```
