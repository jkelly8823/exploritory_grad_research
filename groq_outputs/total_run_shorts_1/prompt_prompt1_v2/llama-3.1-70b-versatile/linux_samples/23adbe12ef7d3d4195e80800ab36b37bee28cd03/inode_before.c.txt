VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a function from the Linux kernel, specifically designed to check if the current task has ownership or capable permissions to a given inode. The function checks if the current task's fsuid matches the inode's owner, or if the inode has CAP_FOWNER capability. The function returns true if either condition is met and false otherwise.

The code snippet does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or logical errors. It appears to be a well-written and secure function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made to fix vulnerabilities in this code snippet, as none were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 * inode_owner_or_capable - check current task permissions to inode
 * @inode: inode being checked
 *
 * Return true if current either has CAP_FOWNER to the inode, or
 * owns the file.
 */
bool inode_owner_or_capable(const struct inode *inode)
{
	if (uid_eq(current_fsuid(), inode->i_uid))
		return true;
	if (inode_capable(inode, CAP_FOWNER))
		return true;
	return false;
}
