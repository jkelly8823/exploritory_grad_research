VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities identified in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel module, checking if the current task has a certain capability in relation to a specific inode. The function `capable_wrt_inode_uidgid` checks for both the capability in the current user namespace and whether the inode's user and group IDs are mapped into this namespace. The use of `current_user_ns` to get the current user namespace and the checks with `ns_capable`, `kuid_has_mapping`, and `kgid_has_mapping` are proper and do not introduce any obvious vulnerabilities. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary as none were identified. However, as with any kernel code, it is critically important to ensure that the `struct inode` and `int cap` inputs are properly validated before passing them to this function to prevent potential issues related to those inputs.
ORIGINAL CODE:

EXPORT_SYMBOL(capable);

/**
 * capable_wrt_inode_uidgid - Check nsown_capable and uid and gid mapped
 * @inode: The inode in question
 * @cap: The capability in question
 *
 * Return true if the current task has the given capability targeted at
 * its own user namespace and that the given inode's uid and gid are
 * mapped into the current user namespace.
 */
bool capable_wrt_inode_uidgid(const struct inode *inode, int cap)
{
	struct user_namespace *ns = current_user_ns();

	return ns_capable(ns, cap) && kuid_has_mapping(ns, inode->i_uid) &&
		kgid_has_mapping(ns, inode->i_gid);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(capable_wrt_inode_uidgid);
