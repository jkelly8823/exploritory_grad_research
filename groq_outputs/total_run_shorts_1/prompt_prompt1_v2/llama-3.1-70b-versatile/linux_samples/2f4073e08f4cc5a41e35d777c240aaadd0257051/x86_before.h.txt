VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected.

EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the given code snippet, no vulnerabilities were identified. The code snippet appears to be defining variables and enums, and a function return statement. However, there is no input, processing, or storage of sensitive data that could potentially expose the code to common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, buffer overflow, cross-site scripting, or insecure access control. 

In the given code snippet, the variables and enums are being defined but are not being used in any way that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are provided.
