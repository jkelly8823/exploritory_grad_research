VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of a static function in C++ or C, checking for specific CPU features related to virtualization. The logic is straightforward and does not exhibit any obvious signs of vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or logical errors. The use of bitwise operations and constants for checking CPU flags is standard practice and does not raise any concerns.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities have been detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return debugctl;
}

static inline bool cpu_has_notify_vmexit(void)
{
    return vmcs_config.cpu_based_2nd_exec_ctrl &
        SECONDARY_EXEC_NOTIFY_VM_EXITING;
}
```
