None. However, as part of overall security best practices, consider enabling more stringent compiler flags for static analysis and using static analysis tools as part of your development workflow.

ORIGINAL CODE:
struct ceph_auth_handshake *(*get_authorizer) (
    struct ceph_connection *con,
    int *proto, int force_new);
int (*verify_authorizer_reply) (struct ceph_connection *con);
int (*invalidate_authorizer)(struct ceph_connection *con);
