Weak Random Number Generation

EXPLANATION:
The `get_random_bytes` function is used to generate a random nonce for the authorizer. However, this function does not guarantee cryptographically secure randomness. If an attacker can predict or influence the output of this function, they may be able to compromise the encryption or authentication process.

In the given code, `get_random_bytes` is called with a size parameter of `sizeof(au->nonce)`, which suggests that the nonce is likely a fixed-size structure. However, the type of `au->nonce` is not specified in the given code snippet.

The use of `get_random_bytes` may not be sufficient to ensure secure randomness, especially in a cryptographic context. Secure random number generation typically involves the use of a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) such as `get_random_bytes_from_cryptographically_secure_source` (e.g., `/dev/urandom`) to generate the nonce.
2. If the `get_random_bytes` function is already a CSPRNG, ensure that it is correctly seeded and configured to produce high-quality, unpredictable random numbers.
3. Consider adding additional entropy or randomness to the nonce generation process to increase its security.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
get_random_bytes(&au->nonce, sizeof(au->nonce));
ret = encrypt_authorizer(au, NULL);
if (ret) {
    pr_err("failed to encrypt authorizer: %d", ret);
    goto out_au;
}
return 0;
