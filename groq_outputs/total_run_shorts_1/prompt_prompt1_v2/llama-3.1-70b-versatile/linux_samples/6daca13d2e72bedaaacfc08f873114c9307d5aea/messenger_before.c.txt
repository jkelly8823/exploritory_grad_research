VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure error message handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided assumes that the connection object `con` is properly initialized and its members are accessible. However, when `verify_authorizer_reply` fails (i.e., `ret` is less than 0), the error message "bad authorize reply" is assigned to `con->error_msg` directly without proper sanitization. This might lead to issues in the program's functionality or potentially disclose sensitive information about the error, as it directly outputs user-controlled data ("authorize reply"). A better practice is to use a more generic or secure error message that doesn't reveal sensitive information about the error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of directly assigning a sensitive error message to `con->error_msg`, it would be better to use a generic or more secure error message. This can be achieved by logging the specific error message internally or by assigning a more generic error message for output. For example:

```c
if (ret < 0) {
    if (con->error_msg_log) {
        snprintf(con->error_msg_log, ERROR_MSG_LOG_SIZE, "Error verifying authorize reply (ret %d)", ret);
    }
    con->error_msg = "Authorization failed";
    return ret;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (con->auth) {
    /*
     * Any connection that defines ->get_authorizer()
     * should also define ->verify_authorizer_reply().
     * See get_connect_authorizer().
     */
    ret = con->ops->verify_authorizer_reply(con);
    if (ret < 0) {
        con->error_msg = "bad authorize reply";
        return ret;
```
