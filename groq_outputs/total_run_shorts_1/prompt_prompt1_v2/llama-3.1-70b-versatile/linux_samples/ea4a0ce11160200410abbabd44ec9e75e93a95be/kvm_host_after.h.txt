VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a header file for KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) functionality. It includes conditional compilation directives based on the configuration of KVM. The code defines two inline functions, `__guest_enter` and `__guest_exit`, which seem to be related to the entry and exit of a guest environment in a virtual machine. These functions do not perform any operations and simply return.

The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. There are no input validation issues, no potential buffer overflows, and no sensitive data leaks observed in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No action is required.
