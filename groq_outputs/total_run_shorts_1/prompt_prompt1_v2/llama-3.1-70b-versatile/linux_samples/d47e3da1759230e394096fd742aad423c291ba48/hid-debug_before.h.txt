VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet consists of preprocessor directives, function declarations, and a struct definition. None of these elements pose a security vulnerability on their own. The preprocessor directives are used for conditional compilation, the function declarations do not contain any implementation that can be vulnerable, and the struct definition is simply defining a data structure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are available, as no vulnerabilities were found.
