VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines two function declarations and three macros for memory management flags. There are no apparent vulnerabilities or potential issues within this code.

The `set_dumpable` and `get_dumpable` function declarations do not contain executable code, and the macros are simply numeric constants. There is no user input, data manipulation, or control flow that could be exploited.

No potential issues related to common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, command injection, or data integrity issues were found in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
extern void set_dumpable(struct mm_struct *mm, int value);
extern int get_dumpable(struct mm_struct *mm);

/* mm flags */
/* dumpable bits */
#define MMF_DUMPABLE      0  /* core dump is permitted */
#define MMF_DUMP_SECURELY 1  /* core file is readable only by root */
