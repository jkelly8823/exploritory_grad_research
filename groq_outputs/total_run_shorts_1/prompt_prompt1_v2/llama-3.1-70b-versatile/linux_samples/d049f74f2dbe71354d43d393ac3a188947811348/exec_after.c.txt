VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
There are no identified vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel implementation, specifically handling privilege transitions and dumpable flags. The code is well-structured, readable, and lacks any evident vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of deprecated functions, or injection risks.

The code does lack context due to being a snippet, but within the context given, it does not appear that any security concerns have been overlooked.

The `__get_dumpable` function is not shown in the snippet, but assuming it is implemented securely, there do not appear to be any issues in the provided code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, this code does not appear to be vulnerable to known common weaknesses in this context.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
	return (ret > SUID_DUMP_USER) ? SUID_DUMP_ROOT : ret;
}

/*
 * This returns the actual value of the suid_dumpable flag. For things
 * that are using this for checking for privilege transitions, it must
 * test against SUID_DUMP_USER rather than treating it as a boolean
 * value.
 */
int get_dumpable(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	return __get_dumpable(mm->flags);
}
