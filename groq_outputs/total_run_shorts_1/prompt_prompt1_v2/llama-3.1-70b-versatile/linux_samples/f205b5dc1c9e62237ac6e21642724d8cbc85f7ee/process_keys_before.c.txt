VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-11, 33-34
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code does not check if a null pointer is dereferenced. In the `install_thread_keyring` function, the variable `new` is checked if it's null only after its value is used in the previous lines.
EXPLANATION:
In both `install_thread_keyring` and `install_process_keyring` functions, the variable `new` is used to access its fields `thread_keyring` and `process_keyring`, but `new` itself is not checked for nullity before those accesses. Then, in the next lines, there is a null check, but this check only happens after the critical lines that access `new`.

Additionally, in the `install_process_keyring_to_cred` function, the pointer `new` is dereferenced at the line `if (new->process_keyring)` without any prior null check.

This can lead to null pointer dereferences and therefore the program's crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we need to move the null check to before we use `new` in all three occurrences. Here is how you could fix it:

```c
static int install_thread_keyring(void)
{
        struct cred *new;
        if (!new)
                return -ENOMEM;

        if (new->thread_keyring)
                BUG_ON(1); // Or handle this scenario as needed
        else
                ret = install_thread_keyring_to_cred(new);

        if (ret < 0) {
                abort_creds(new);
                return ret;
        }
}

static int install_process_keyring(void)
{
        struct cred *new;
        if (!new)
                return -ENOMEM;

        if (!new->process_keyring)
                ret = install_process_keyring_to_cred(new);

        if (ret < 0) {
                abort_creds(new);
                return ret != -EEXIST ? ret : 0;
        }

        return commit_creds(new);
}

int install_process_keyring_to_cred(struct cred *new)
{
        if (!new)
                return -EFAULT; // Or return an error as needed

        if (new->process_keyring)
                return -EEXIST;

        struct key *keyring;
        keyring = keyring_alloc("_pid", new->uid, new->gid, new,
                        KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_VIEW,
```
