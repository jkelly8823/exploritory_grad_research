VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code appears to be vulnerable to potential null pointer dereferences.

EXPLANATION:
In multiple places throughout the code, the pointer `new` is used without a null check before being dereferenced. Although there are checks for `new` being null, these checks are incomplete or do not handle all cases.

In the `install_thread_keyring` function, the variable `new` is checked to see if it is null, but if it is not null, it is not checked again before being dereferenced.

Similarly, in the `install_process_keyring` function, the variable `new` is not checked to see if it is null before being dereferenced.

Furthermore, in multiple functions, the return value of `install_thread_keyring_to_cred` and `install_process_keyring_to_cred` is not checked before being assigned to the `ret` variable. If these functions fail, they will return a negative value, which will cause the `ret` variable to be negative, potentially leading to an incorrect interpretation of the result.

Additionally, there are missing checks for the return value of `keyring_alloc` in `install_thread_keyring_to_cred` and `install_process_keyring_to_cred`. If `keyring_alloc` fails, it will return NULL, which will not be checked for before being dereferenced.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the potential null pointer dereferences, additional null checks should be added to ensure that `new` is not null before being dereferenced.

Additionally, the return value of `install_thread_keyring_to_cred` and `install_process_keyring_to_cred` should be checked before being assigned to the `ret` variable.

Moreover, the return value of `keyring_alloc` in `install_thread_keyring_to_cred` and `install_process_keyring_to_cred` should be checked for NULL before being dereferenced.
