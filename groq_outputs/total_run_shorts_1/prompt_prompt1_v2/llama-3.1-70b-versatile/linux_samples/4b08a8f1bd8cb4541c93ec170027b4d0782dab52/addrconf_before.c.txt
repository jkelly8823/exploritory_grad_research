VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential double-free vulnerability or resource leak.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises due to the possibility of a double-free or resource leak. The `in6_ifa_put(ifp)` and `in6_dev_put(idev)` calls decrement the reference counts of `ifp` and `idev`, respectively. However, before calling these functions, the `ift` pointer is set based on the error status of `ipv6_add_addr`. 

If `ipv6_add_addr` fails and returns an error, then `ift` would be set to an error pointer. The subsequent calls to `in6_ifa_put` and `in6_dev_put` may decrement the reference counts to zero, potentially freeing the resources. 

However, without knowing the implementation details of `ipv6_add_addr`, it's possible that the `ifp` and `idev` pointers hold valid data even in the case of an error. If these resources were previously allocated with `in6_ifa_hold` and `in6_dev_hold` respectively, the subsequent calls to `in6_ifa_put` and `in6_dev_put` in error handling could free resources that are still needed, potentially leading to double-free errors.

Furthermore, if `ifp` and `idev` were previously held by other parts of the code using `in6_ifa_hold` and `in6_dev_hold`, the decrementing of their reference counts by `in6_ifa_put` and `in6_dev_put` may free resources prematurely, leading to potential crashes or other system instability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the implementation details of `ipv6_add_addr` to understand the behavior of `ifp` and `idev` in case of an error. 
- Consider using `in6_ifa_hold` and `in6_dev_hold` to increment the reference counts before calling `ipv6_add_addr`, ensuring that the resources are properly protected.
- Ensure that the calls to `in6_ifa_put` and `in6_dev_put` in error handling are properly synchronized with any other holds on `ifp` and `idev`, to prevent premature resource deallocation.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	if (ifp->flags & IFA_F_OPTIMISTIC)
		addr_flags |= IFA_F_OPTIMISTIC;

	ift = !max_addresses ||
	      ipv6_count_addresses(idev) < max_addresses ?
		ipv6_add_addr(idev, &addr, NULL, tmp_plen,
			      ipv6_addr_scope(&addr), addr_flags,
			      tmp_valid_lft, tmp_prefered_lft) : NULL;
	if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(ift)) {
		in6_ifa_put(ifp);
		in6_dev_put(idev);
		pr_info("%s: retry temporary address regeneration\n", __func__);
		tmpaddr = &addr;
