VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential denial of service due to infinite loop or CPU resource exhaustion caused by unbounded recursion in the `native_write_cr4` function.

EXPLANATION:
The `native_write_cr4` function appears to be an atomic operation, but in certain conditions, it may lead to a potentially unlimited recursion. If the condition `static_branch_likely(&cr_pinning)` is true and `(val & cr4_pinned_bits) != cr4_pinned_bits`, it will enter a loop to re-set the missing CR4 bits. However, if `cr4_pinned_bits` keeps being different after the loop, this could result in an infinite recursion or CPU resource exhaustion. This is especially concerning in high-availability or resource-constrained systems.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Introduce a limit on the recursion depth to avoid infinite recursion.
```c
int retries = 0;
while (static_branch_likely(&cr_pinning) && unlikely((val & cr4_pinned_bits) != cr4_pinned_bits)) {
    bits_missing = ~val & cr4_pinned_bits;
    val |= bits_missing;
    if (++retries > MAX_RETRIES) {
        /* Error handling for when CR4 bits cannot be set */
        ...
    }
}
```
2. Implement additional sanity checks on the input values for `native_write_cr4` to ensure that the condition triggering recursion is rare and not exploitable.
