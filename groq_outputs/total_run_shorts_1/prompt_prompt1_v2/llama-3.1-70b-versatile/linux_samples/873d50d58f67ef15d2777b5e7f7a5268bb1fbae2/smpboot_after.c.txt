VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found
EXPLANATION:
Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, I did not identify any potential vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a part of a low-level, architecture-specific initialization function. It modifies CPU state and page tables, but it does not handle user input, and it does not contain any obvious signs of insecure coding practices.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
/**
 * notrace start_secondary(void *unused)
{
	unsigned long cr4 = __read_cr4();

	/*
	 * Don't put *anything* except direct CPU state initialization
	 * before cpu_init(), SMP booting is too fragile that we want to
	 * limit the things done here to the most necessary things.
	 */
	if (boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_PCID))
		cr4 |= X86_CR4_PCIDE;
	if (static_branch_likely(&cr_pinning))
		cr4 |= cr4_pinned_bits;

	__write_cr4(cr4);

#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
	/* switch away from the initial page table */
	load_cr3(swapper_pg_dir);
