VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Memory Leak and use of unincremented pointer

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the usage of `gnttab_list[i]` when `gnttab_list[i]` has been set to `NULL`.  The memory allocation in the `for` loop for `gnttab_list[i]` checks if allocation is successful and sets a return value if it fails. However, after this loop, the code doesn't check if `gnttab_list[i]` is `NULL` when it is being used. 

Furthermore, in the function `gnttab_expand`, there is no null check for `gnttab_list[i]` after it is allocated using `__get_free_page(GFP_ATOMIC)`.

Additionally, no check for integer overflow has been done for `new_nr_glist_frames` and `new_nr_grant_frames` when they are calculated. If the left operand of `/` can be zero, it might produce undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add null checks for `gnttab_list[i]` before it is used.
- Consider using safer functions like `memdup_user()` which will prevent potential issues like allocation errors or memory leaks.
- Implement overflow checks when performing arithmetic operations.
- When handling errors from memory allocation, consider freeing the previously allocated memory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
(only the original vulnerable code will be presented here)

```
for (i = nr_glist_frames; i < new_nr_glist_frames; i++) {
    gnttab_list[i] = (grant_ref_t *)__get_free_page(GFP_ATOMIC);
    if (!gnttab_list[i])
        goto grow_nomem;
}
```
