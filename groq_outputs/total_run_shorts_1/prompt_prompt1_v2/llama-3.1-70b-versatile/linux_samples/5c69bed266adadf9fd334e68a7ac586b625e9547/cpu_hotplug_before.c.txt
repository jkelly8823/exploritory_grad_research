VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow in sprintf, due to potential integer overflow when printing 'cpu' into 'dir'.

EXPLANATION:
The use of sprintf is a common source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. When the unsinged integer 'cpu' is printed into 'dir', it is not checked whether this operation will exceed the allocated buffer size. Furthermore, the '%u' format specifier allows for integer value overflows when printing 'cpu', potentially leading to writing beyond the buffer boundaries, because the destination buffer 'dir' is only 32 bytes in length.

Additionally, although not a buffer overflow, there is the assumption of a non-negative return from scanf to set the string to 31 characters plus the terminator, but the first 32 character it could meet, from "availability", can set state to a fixed buffer overflow.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability:
   * Replace the sprintf call with a safer function that checks the buffer length, such as snprintf (e.g., snprintf(dir, sizeof(dir), "cpu/%u", cpu)).
   * Avoid magic numbers, and instead declare constants for buffer sizes (e.g., '#define BUFFER_SIZE 32', and then declare 'char dir[BUFFER_SIZE]', and use 'BUFFER_SIZE' when calling snprintf).
   * Verify the length of 'dir' and 'state' before calling xenbus_scanf.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int vcpu_online(unsigned int cpu)
{
	int err;
	char dir[32], state[32];

	sprintf(dir, "cpu/%u", cpu);
	err = xenbus_scanf(XBT_NIL, dir, "availability", "%s", state);
	if (err != 1) {
		if (!xen_initial_domain())
			printk(KERN_ERR "XENBUS: Unable to read cpu state\n");
		return err;
```
