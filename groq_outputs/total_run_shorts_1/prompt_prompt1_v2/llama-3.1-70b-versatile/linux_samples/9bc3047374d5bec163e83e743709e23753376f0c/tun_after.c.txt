VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The use of INT_MAX as the skb sndbuf size could lead to potential integer overflows or exhaustion of system memory resources, considering skb sender's buffer can hold up to INT_MAX bytes of data.

EXPLANATION:
Upon examining the provided code snippet, it appears that the socket buffer's send buffer size (skb_sndbuf) is being set to INT_MAX. This is a warning sign as it allows the send buffer to potentially hold an extremely large amount of data, which could lead to an integer overflow or system memory resource exhaustion if not handled properly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address the vulnerability, a reasonable cap should be placed on the skb_sndbuf size. This could be implemented using tunable configuration options or setting a more sensible maximum value. Here is a revised code snippet:

```c
tfile->socket.file = file;
tfile->socket.ops = &tun_socket_ops;

sock_init_data_uid(&tfile->socket, &tfile->sk, current_fsuid());

tfile->sk.sk_write_space = tun_sock_write_space;
tfile->sk.sk_sndbuf = 65535;  // Use a more reasonable sndbuf size
```

This size can be fine-tuned depending on the system requirements and constraints.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	tfile->socket.file = file;
	tfile->socket.ops = &tun_socket_ops;

	sock_init_data_uid(&tfile->socket, &tfile->sk, current_fsuid());

	tfile->sk.sk_write_space = tun_sock_write_space;
	tfile->sk.sk_sndbuf = INT_MAX;
```
