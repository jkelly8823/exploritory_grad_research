VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The given code snippet appears to be a series of constant definitions using the preprocessor (`#define`). The definitions are for masks and shift values related to interrupt handling and prioritization. Upon analysis, no potential security vulnerabilities were found. The code snippet does not involve any dynamic input, allocation, pointer arithmetic, or other potentially exploitable operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define V_IGN_TPR_SHIFT 20
