VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability and Potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, there are two potential vulnerabilities present.

1. Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability:
   In the code snippet, there is a check for write access denial at the beginning of the function and then later the file is assigned to the `mm->exe_file` pointer. However, there is a possibility that the write access might be granted to the file between the denial check and the file pointer assignment. This might allow a malicious user to execute the file even after the deny_write_access check has passed.

   Furthermore, at lines 16-17, we see `deny_write_access(new_exe_file)` called potentially on an object without checking the return value later, potentially leading to TOCTOU in later code.

2. Potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability:
   If the `fput(old_exe_file);` statement is executed before the check for `old_exe_file`, this can lead to a potential UAF if another thread accesses `old_exe_file` before the `fput` statement is executed but after the pointer has been reassigned to the new file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate these vulnerabilities:

1. Perform the deny_write_access check immediately before the file usage.
2. The use of the old_exe_file pointer should be synchronized to ensure that the fput statement is executed before another thread accesses the old_exe_file pointer.
3. Consider using a lock to prevent other threads from accessing the old_exe_file pointer while the current thread is executing the fput statement.

ORIGINAL CODE:


	exe_file = get_mm_exe_file(oldmm);
	RCU_INIT_POINTER(mm->exe_file, exe_file);
	/*
	 * We depend on the oldmm having properly denied write access to the
	 * exe_file already.
	 */
	if (exe_file && deny_write_access(exe_file))
		pr_warn_once("deny_write_access() failed in %s\n", __func__);
}

#ifdef CONFIG_MMU
static __latent_entropy int dup_mmap(struct mm_struct *mm,
	 */
	old_exe_file = rcu_dereference_raw(mm->exe_file);

	if (new_exe_file) {
		/*
		 * We expect the caller (i.e., sys_execve) to already denied
		 * write access, so this is unlikely to fail.
		 */
		if (unlikely(deny_write_access(new_exe_file)))
			return -EACCES;
		get_file(new_exe_file);
	}
	rcu_assign_pointer(mm->exe_file, new_exe_file);
	if (old_exe_file) {
		allow_write_access(old_exe_file);
		fput(old_exe_file);
	}
	return 0;
}

/**
			return ret;
	}

	ret = deny_write_access(new_exe_file);
	if (ret)
		return -EACCES;
	get_file(new_exe_file);

	/* set the new file */
	mmap_write_lock(mm);
	rcu_assign_pointer(mm->exe_file, new_exe_file);
	mmap_write_unlock(mm);

	if (old_exe_file) {
		allow_write_access(old_exe_file);
		fput(old_exe_file);
	}
	return 0;
