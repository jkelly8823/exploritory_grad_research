VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use After Free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `lockless_dereference` function is used to safely dereference a pointer, but it does not acquire a lock on the referenced object. However, in this code, after `ldt` is dereferenced, its entries and size are used in the `set_ldt` function. If the `ldt_struct` is freed before this operation completes, it would result in a use-after-free vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because the code relies on the `ldt_struct` not being freed until the IPI is handled by all CPUs with the mm active, but it doesn't actually prevent the `ldt_struct` from being freed before that.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent the use-after-free vulnerability, a lock should be acquired on the `ldt_struct` before using its entries and size, and released after the `set_ldt` function completes. Alternatively, use RCU (Read-Copy Update) to ensure that the `ldt_struct` is not freed prematurely.

	 *
	 * NB: don't try to convert this to use RCU without extreme care.
