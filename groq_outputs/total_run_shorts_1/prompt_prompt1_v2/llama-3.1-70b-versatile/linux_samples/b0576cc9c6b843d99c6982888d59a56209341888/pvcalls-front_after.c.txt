VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-After-Free vulnerability in alloc_active_ring function.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, there is a possibility of a Use-After-Free vulnerability. In the alloc_active_ring function, it appears that map->active.ring is freed, but then its ring_order attribute is accessed in the free_pages_exact function. This can lead to a situation where memory is freed, but its contents are still accessed, potentially leading to undefined behavior or even code execution.

However, upon closer inspection, it seems that the free operation is not present in the alloc_active_ring function, but the assign operation to ring_order attribute takes place before the allocation of bytes. This indicates that map->active.ring might be used before it is initialized or allocated.

But in the first part of the code snippet, there's a possibility of map->active.ring being freed before its use in alloc_active_ring function. Thus a null pointer dereference might occur or use-after-free scenario if the same pointer is reused.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, there should be some mechanism in place to ensure that map->active.ring is not accessed after it has been freed. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Set map->active.ring to NULL after freeing: This would help prevent any accidental use of the freed pointer.
2. Use a locking mechanism: Implement a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent access to map->active.ring while it is being freed.
3. Check for null pointer before use: Before accessing map->active.ring, ensure that it is not NULL.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (!map->active.ring)
	return;

free_pages_exact(map->active.data.in,
			 PAGE_SIZE << map->active.ring->ring_order);
free_page((unsigned long)map->active.ring);
}

static int alloc_active_ring(struct sock_mapping *map)
		goto out;

	map->active.ring->ring_order = PVCALLS_RING_ORDER;
	bytes = alloc_pages_exact(PAGE_SIZE << PVCALLS_RING_ORDER,
				  GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO);
	if (!bytes)
		goto out;

	map->active.data.in = bytes;
```
