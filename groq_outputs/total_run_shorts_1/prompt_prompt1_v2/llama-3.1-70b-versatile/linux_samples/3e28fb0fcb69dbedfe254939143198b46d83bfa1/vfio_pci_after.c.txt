VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a PCIe device driver that attempts to add a dynamic ID using the `pci_add_dynid` function. The code checks the return code (`rc`) of the function and prints an error message if the addition fails. 

Upon analyzing the given code snippet, no apparent security vulnerabilities were detected. The code does not appear to handle any user-provided input directly and does not provide any indication of buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other potential security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As no vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet, no specific recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are provided.

ORIGINAL CODE:

		rc = pci_add_dynid(&vfio_pci_driver, vendor, device,
				   subvendor, subdevice, class, class_mask, 0);
		if (rc)
			pr_warn("failed to add dynamic id [%04x:%04x[%04x:%04x]] class %#08x/%08x (%d)\n",
				vendor, device, subvendor, subdevice,
				class, class_mask, rc);
		else
			pr_info("add [%04x:%04x[%04x:%04x]] class %#08x/%08x\n",
				vendor, device, subvendor, subdevice,
				class, class_mask);
