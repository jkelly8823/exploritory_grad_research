VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code appears to be dealing with error handling and initialization of policy-related data structures in a network context, specifically in the area of IPsec. The use of `memset` suggests proper handling of memory and clearing sensitive data. The assignment to `xdst->flo.ops` is an assignment, not a potential source of input validation or arbitrary write vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of a constant error code (-ENOBUFS) and `ERR_PTR` to indicate an error is proper practice.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
		memset(dst + 1, 0, sizeof(*xdst) - sizeof(*dst));
		xdst->flo.ops = &xfrm_bundle_fc_ops;
	} else
		xdst = ERR_PTR(-ENOBUFS);

	xfrm_policy_put_afinfo(afinfo);
```
