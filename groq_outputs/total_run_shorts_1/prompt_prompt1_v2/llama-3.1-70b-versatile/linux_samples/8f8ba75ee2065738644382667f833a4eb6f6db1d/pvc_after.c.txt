VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code appears to be initializing a sockaddr_atmpvc structure with specific address family and ATM PVC values. It is using memset to set the structure to zero before assigning values, which is a good practice to prevent issues with undefined values. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet, such as use of insecure functions, buffer overflows, or potential null pointer dereferences.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As no vulnerabilities were found, there are no specific recommendations for fixing this code. However, it is essential to ensure that variables 'sockaddr' and 'sockaddr_len' are checked for null and overflows before being used in the original code to prevent potential issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	return -ENOTCONN;
	*sockaddr_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_atmpvc);
	addr = (struct sockaddr_atmpvc *)sockaddr;
	memset(addr, 0, sizeof(*addr));
	addr->sap_family = AF_ATMPVC;
	addr->sap_addr.itf = vcc->dev->number;
	addr->sap_addr.vpi = vcc->vpi;
	addr->sap_addr.vci = vcc->vci;
