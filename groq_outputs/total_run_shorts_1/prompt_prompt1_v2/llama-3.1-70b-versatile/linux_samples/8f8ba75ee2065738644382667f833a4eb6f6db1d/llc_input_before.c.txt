VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6, 15-18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference and potential memory leaks in the `llc_add_pack` and anonymous block functions. The `llc_set_station_handler` function also has a potential null pointer dereference. 

Additionally, there is an issue with memory management for `skb` in multiple places.

EXPLANATION:
In `llc_add_pack`, if `type` is equal to `LLC_DEST_SAP` or `LLC_DEST_CONN`, the corresponding `llc_type_handlers` is set to the provided `handler`. However, in the anonymous block immediately following, this is set to `NULL`, which can result in null pointer dereferences if this handler is called later in the code.

In `llc_set_station_handler`, when a new handler is set, the old handler is overwritten without being freed or called to clean up any allocated resources. This can lead to memory leaks.

Furthermore, the `llc_pdu_type` function (commented out in the provided code) does not correctly handle the case where `rcv` is non-NULL but the handling fails. The `skb` is freed, but if `cskb` is also non-NULL and has the same contents, this could result in memory corruption if `rcv` attempts to use this memory.

In the commented code, there appears to be confusion regarding the `skb` and `cskb` variables. `skb` is freed regardless of whether `rcv` or `llc_type_handlers[dest - 1]` handles the packet, but there is no corresponding `kfree_skb` call for `cskb` if `rcv` handles it. 

However, given the missing context, this appears to be correct since, according to the given code, there is indeed `kfree_skb(skb)` in the end of the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* In `llc_add_pack`, instead of immediately overwriting the handler, ensure that the old handler is freed before setting the new one. However, since this seems to be a setting function for a callback, consider adding error checking that would reject a NULL callback.

* In `llc_set_station_handler`, consider adding a check for the old handler and freeing any allocated resources before overwriting it.

* Verify that `llc_type_handlers[dest - 1]` and `llc_station_handler` are properly checked for NULL before being dereferenced. If they are not checked elsewhere in the code, ensure that error checking is in place.
