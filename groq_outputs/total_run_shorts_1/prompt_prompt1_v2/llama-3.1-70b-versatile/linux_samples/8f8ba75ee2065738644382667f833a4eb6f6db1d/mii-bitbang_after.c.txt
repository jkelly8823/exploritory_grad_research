VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential memory leak due to improper error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet allocates memory for `new_bus->irq` using `kmalloc`. However, in the event that `kmalloc` fails and returns `NULL`, the code sets `ret` to `-ENOMEM` and jumps to the `out_unmap_regs` label. This suggests that there are resources allocated prior to this point that need to be released. However, if `kmalloc` fails, `new_bus->phy_mask` is not reset or released, potentially leading to a resource leak. Additionally, there is no check if `kmalloc` returns an error due to an out-of-memory condition and fails to allocate the requested amount of memory, but the returned value is not `NULL`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
When handling memory allocation failures, it is crucial to ensure that all previously allocated resources are properly released. To fix this issue, add code to release any resources allocated prior to the `kmalloc` call when an error occurs, and also set `new_bus->phy_mask` to its default value (if applicable) to prevent the resource leak.

```c
new_bus->phy_mask = ~0;
new_bus->irq = kmalloc(sizeof(int) * PHY_MAX_ADDR, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!new_bus->irq) {
    new_bus->phy_mask = 0; // Or set to default value
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto out_unmap_regs;
}
```

Additionally, to prevent the potential memory corruption in case of out-of-memory conditions, considering the use of `kzalloc` instead of `kmalloc` for initializing the allocated memory to zero, and checking if the returned value is indeed `NULL` in case of an out-of-memory condition.

```c
new_bus->irq = kzalloc(sizeof(int) * PHY_MAX_ADDR, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!new_bus->irq) {
    // Handle Out-of-Memory error
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
new_bus->phy_mask = ~0;
new_bus->irq = kmalloc(sizeof(int) * PHY_MAX_ADDR, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!new_bus->irq) {
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto out_unmap_regs;
}

new_bus->parent = &ofdev->dev;
dev_set_drvdata(&ofdev->dev, new_bus);
```
