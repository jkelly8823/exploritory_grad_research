VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of a network management routine, handling IPv6-related functions. The analyzed code snippet doesn't present any obvious vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to breach security.

However, it's essential to consider the `goto` statement can potentially introduce complexity and potentially lead to vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, in this specific case, the code doesn't demonstrate any immediate risk.

The function `proc_net_remove(net, "dev_snmp6");` calls, which could potentially allow an attacker to cause issues if 'net' is not validated. Nonetheless, given the context and nature of this snippet appearing to be low-level, specific C-language functions related to "proc_net_remove" being wrapped within functions like "ipv6_proc_exit_net" and parameters as 'net,' and 'net' being passed as a pointer, has led me to suspect validation or removal operations already occurred within a separate function call.

Finally, considering 'ipv6_proc_exit_net' being called when exiting the 'net' network space on __net_exit, could either validate input parameters - when dealing with "proc_net_remove" that would hinder possible 'net' value compromises.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Considering the snippet's low-level, specific nature and its role within '__net_exit', there are no clear indications additional checks or code can serve as specific protective measures on these lines.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	goto proc_dev_snmp6_fail;
	return 0;

proc_snmp6_fail:
	proc_net_remove(net, "sockstat6");
proc_dev_snmp6_fail:
	proc_net_remove(net, "dev_snmp6");
	return -ENOMEM;
}

static void __net_exit ipv6_proc_exit_net(struct net *net)
```
