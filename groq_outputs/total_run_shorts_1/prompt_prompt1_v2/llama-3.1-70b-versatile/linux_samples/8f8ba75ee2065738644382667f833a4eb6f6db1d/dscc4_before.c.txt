VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to incorrect error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using `pci_alloc_consistent`, which returns a pointer to the allocated memory. However, in the event of a memory allocation failure, the function immediately jumps to the `err_free_irq_5` label without freeing any previously allocated resources. This can lead to memory leaks if the function was previously able to allocate memory successfully before failing. 

The issue is specifically on line 4, `if (!priv->iqcfg) goto err_free_irq_5;` where the function does not properly handle the memory allocation error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should free any previously allocated memory before jumping to the error handling label. This will prevent memory leaks in the event of a memory allocation failure. Here's an example of how you could modify the code:
```c
if (!priv->iqcfg) {
    /* Free any previously allocated resources here */
    pci_free_consistent(pdev, IRQ_RING_SIZE*sizeof(__le32), priv->iqcfg_dma);
    goto err_free_irq_5;
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
}
/* Global interrupt queue */
	writel((u32)(((IRQ_RING_SIZE >> 5) - 1) << 20), ioaddr + IQLENR1);
	priv->iqcfg = (__le32 *) pci_alloc_consistent(pdev,
		IRQ_RING_SIZE*sizeof(__le32), &priv->iqcfg_dma);
	if (!priv->iqcfg)
	 goto err_free_irq_5;
	writel(priv->iqcfg_dma, ioaddr + IQCFG);

	rc = -ENOMEM;

	/*
	 * SCC 0-3 private rx/tx irq structures
	 * IQRX/TXi needs to be set soon. Learned it the hard way...
