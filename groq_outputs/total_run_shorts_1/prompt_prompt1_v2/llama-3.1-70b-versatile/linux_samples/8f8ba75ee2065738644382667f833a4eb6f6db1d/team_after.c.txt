VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15, 20-21
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential double-free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the code snippet, there are two instances where a pointer is deallocated without checking if it has been previously deallocated. This can happen when an error occurs after `np` has been allocated and deallocated once.
 
1. In the first instance (line 14-15), `__netpoll_setup` is called and it may return an error. If it does, `kzalloc` and `__netpoll_setup` both allocate memory which is then deallocated twice if an error occurs. This would lead to a double-free vulnerability, which is undefined behavior and can potentially crash the program.

2. In the second instance (line 20-21), `team_port_enable_netpoll` is called from `team_netpoll_setup`. However, `team_netpoll_setup` calls `__team_netpoll_cleanup(team)` when `team_port_enable_netpoll` fails. It's unclear from the given code if `__team_netpoll_cleanup(team)` includes freeing resources which are later attempted to be freed when `team_port_enable_netpoll` is exited normally. Without more information, we must assume this is undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always check if a pointer has been deallocated before attempting to deallocate it again.
- Make sure to properly clean up resources in error paths and avoid freeing resources in cleanup functions that may already be freed in the error path.
