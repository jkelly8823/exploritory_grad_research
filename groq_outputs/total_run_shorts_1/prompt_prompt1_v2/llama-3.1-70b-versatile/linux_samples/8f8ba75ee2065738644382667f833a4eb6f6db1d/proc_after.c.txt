VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet is a small portion of a larger function or module, likely responsible for handling IPv6-related tasks. It contains a couple of labels and jumps, which are typically not a cause for concern on their own.

The function appears to be handling the removal of certain network interfaces or statistics, and there doesn't seem to be any obvious vulnerabilities in this specific snippet. There are no apparent uses of untrusted or unsanitized input, no attempts to access data outside of expected bounds, and no potentially problematic memory management.

That being said, without more context about the surrounding code or the purpose of this function, it's difficult to provide an exhaustive analysis. However, based solely on the given snippet, there are no immediately apparent vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities can be provided in this case, as none were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	goto proc_dev_snmp6_fail;
	return 0;

	proc_net_remove(net, "snmp6");
proc_snmp6_fail:
	proc_net_remove(net, "sockstat6");
	return -ENOMEM;
}
