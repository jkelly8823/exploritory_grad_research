VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to missing error handling

EXPLANATION:
The code assigns resources using `l2cap_chan_holds` function, but in case an error occurs after this point and the function returns, these resources are not released. Although the `l2cap_sock_kill` function is called in the event of an error early in the function, this does not mitigate the error, as it occurs later.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, resources should be properly cleaned up on function exit by introducing additional error handling or using techniques such as RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). The `l2cap_chan_put` function can be used to release the held resource in error cases.

```c
chan = l2cap_chan_create();
if (!chan) {
    l2cap_sock_kill(sk);
    return NULL;
}

l2cap_chan_hold(chan);
...
if (some_error_occurs) {
    l2cap_chan_put(chan);  // This should be called in case of an error
    return NULL;
}
...
```
Alternatively, using an RAII approach or introducing a try-catch-finally block can ensure that resources are properly cleaned up regardless of the function's control flow.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
BT_DBG("sock %p, sk %p", sock, sk);

addr->sa_family = AF_BLUETOOTH;
*len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_l2);

if (peer) {

chan = l2cap_chan_create();
if (!chan) {
    l2cap_sock_kill(sk);
    return NULL;
}

l2cap_chan_hold(chan);
```
