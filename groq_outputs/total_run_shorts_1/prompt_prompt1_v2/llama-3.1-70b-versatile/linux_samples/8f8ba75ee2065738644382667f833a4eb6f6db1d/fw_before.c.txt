VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Null Dereference in case of out-of-memory (OOM) error

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to access the first character of the `token` variable without checking if `token` is NULL. In this case, `strsep` function can potentially return a null pointer when the separator is not found or when the data pointer has reached the end. However, in this scenario, another potential case for null pointer is when strsep returns the empty token (""). In this case, it checks for an empty string and eats the joint commas. On the other hand, when `kstrdup` results in a null pointer, the program checks and handles this OOM error, but when `strsep` returns a pointer to the joint commas (""), it evaluates the '*token' without first verifying that the value of 'token' itself is not null. However, in this example, we actually see this is indeed being performed correctly '*token' by seeing 'if (*token == '\0')'.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of testing the pointer 'token' for emptiness using '*token == '\0' ' or 'if (*token == '\0') ',  we evaluate *token safely and validate the token is in fact non-null. Here's a safer and idiomatic expression using explicit pointer check before dereferencing. Here's how you could better express it:
		
			while ((token = strsep(&options, ",")) != NULL) {
				if (token != NULL && (strlen(token) == 0 || *token == '\0'))   /* eat joint commas */

This construct, in effect, has a single comparison for testing emptiness.
