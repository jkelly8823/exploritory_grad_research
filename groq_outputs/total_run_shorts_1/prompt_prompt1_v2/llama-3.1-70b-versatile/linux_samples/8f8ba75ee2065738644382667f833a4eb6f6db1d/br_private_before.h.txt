VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's networking code. It provides inline functions for working with Netpoll bridge code. However, upon reviewing the code, I did not detect any potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, or use-after-free conditions. The functions appear to be properly declared, and the code does not seem to be handling sensitive data or making any potentially insecure system calls.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, the code appears to be secure.
ORIGINAL CODE:


		netpoll_send_skb(np, skb);
}

extern int br_netpoll_enable(struct net_bridge_port *p);
extern void br_netpoll_disable(struct net_bridge_port *p);
#else
static inline struct netpoll_info *br_netpoll_info(struct net_bridge *br)
{
{
}

static inline int br_netpoll_enable(struct net_bridge_port *p)
{
	return 0;
}
