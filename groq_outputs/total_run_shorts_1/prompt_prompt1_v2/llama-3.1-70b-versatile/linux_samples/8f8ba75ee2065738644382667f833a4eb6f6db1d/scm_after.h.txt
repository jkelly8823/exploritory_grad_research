VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present on line 9, where the `__scm_send` function is called with the `scm` struct pointer as an argument. However, there is no check to ensure that the `scm` pointer is not null before the function call. If the `scm` pointer is null, this would result in a null pointer dereference, potentially causing the program to crash or be vulnerable to exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend adding a null pointer check before calling the `__scm_send` function:

Replace the last line with:
```c
if (scm != NULL) {
    return __scm_send(sock, msg, scm);
} else {
    // Handle null pointer case, e.g., return an error or abort the function
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
}
static __inline__ int scm_send(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg,
			       struct scm_cookie *scm, bool forcecreds)
{
 memset(scm, 0, sizeof(*scm));
 if (forcecreds)
  scm_set_cred(scm, task_tgid(current), current_cred());
 unix_get_peersec_dgram(sock, scm);
 if (msg->msg_controllen <= 0)
  return 0;
 return __scm_send(sock, msg, scm);
```
