VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of a switch case statement handling a specific socket option. The code checks if the provided length is less than the size of a `tfrc` structure and returns an error if it is. Otherwise, it assigns various values from `hc` to corresponding fields in `tfrc`. No apparent vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as this code appears to be secure.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
case DCCP_SOCKOPT_CCID_TX_INFO:
	if (len < sizeof(tfrc))
		return -EINVAL;
	tfrc.tfrctx_x	   = hc->tx_x;
	tfrc.tfrctx_x_recv = hc->tx_x_recv;
	tfrc.tfrctx_x_calc = hc->tx_x_calc;
	tfrc.tfrctx_rtt	   = hc->tx_rtt;
```
