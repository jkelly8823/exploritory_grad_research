VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability, as it is missing bounds checking on the data received from the USB device.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `usb_control_msg` function to receive data from a USB device, but it does not check the validity or length of the received data. The `usb_control_msg` function can return a negative value if an error occurs, but it can also return the actual length of data received. If the length of the received data is greater than the size of the buffer `state`, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add bounds checking on the received data to ensure it does not exceed the size of the buffer. You should also check the return value of the `usb_control_msg` function to ensure that the transfer was successful. For example:
```
int len = usb_control_msg(udev, usb_rcvctrlpipe(udev, 0), DFU_GETSTATE, ...);
if (len < 0) {
    // handle error
} else if (len > sizeof(*state)) {
    // buffer overflow, handle error
} else {
    // transfer successful, process received data
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
return ret;
}

static int at76_dfu_get_state(struct usb_device *udev, u8 *state)
{
	int ret;

	ret = usb_control_msg(udev, usb_rcvctrlpipe(udev, 0), DFU_GETSTATE,
```
