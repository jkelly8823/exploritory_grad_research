VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer overflow in the `__netpoll_rx` function
EXPLANATION:
This is not directly determinable given the code presented. However, looking through the code, it appears that the provided code only deals with function declarations and does not show any integer overflows. 

However, I see one potential issue with this code. Function `__netpoll_rx` is supposed to return an integer value, which might be compared with a certain threshold to check buffer overflow. However, its definition is missing in the provided snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The fix depends on where the actual implementation of `__netpoll_rx` function is and how it is managing buffers. The function should be reviewed to ensure it doesn't exceed the buffer size, and prevent any potential overflows.
