VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a C function, specifically used in Linux kernel development for 802.11 wireless networking. It involves memory reallocation using `krealloc`, which is a kernel-specific function. However, the code seems to handle the reallocation properly by checking the return value of `krealloc` for errors and handling the failure case.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code seems to be correctly implemented. However, as a general security practice, it's always recommended to validate user input parameters such as `max_pmkids` (not used in this snippet), even if they are not present in this particular snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct cfg80211_pmksa *pmksa,
						int max_pmkids)
{
	int i, err, newlen;
	unsigned int count;

	count = le32_to_cpu(pmkids->bssid_info_count);
	/* add new pmkid */
	newlen = sizeof(*pmkids) + (count + 1) * sizeof(pmkids->bssid_info[0]);

	pmkids = krealloc(pmkids, newlen, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!pmkids) {
		err = -ENOMEM;
		goto error;
	}

	pmkids->length = cpu_to_le32(newlen);
	pmkids->bssid_info_count = cpu_to_le32(count + 1);
```
