VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 156-158, 192-194
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Use of potentially tainted input in string format functionality (Simple Strtoul).

EXPLANATION: 
The function simple_strtoul() is used to convert a string to an unsigned int, but the functionality can pose a problem when being fed a tainted or malicious input. In this case, the strings that are fed into the simple_strtoul() calls on lines 156-158 and 192-194 can be tainted, as it seems to be being obtained from a network connection in line with network address related variables provided by an input ct, and can be assumed as not reliable. 

Therefore an attacker might have the ability to inject malicious data and put the program out of the expected normal flow. Simple_strtoul on tainted data will execute unchecked by the mechanism of input validation. 
Furthermore this may, among other cases, set a pathway for possible remote code execution as well as heap overwriting attacks in a more prolonged and serious path escalation scheme through the rest of the program, particularly when the return results gets further interpreted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Fix this function so that the data input coming in from the network goes through proper validation in order to stop tainted string from ending up within these string functions. It's worth noting that because here simple_strtoul() may successfully return, however, you should not be using tainted data without determining its ability fit into your functions according API documentation. Here you may utilize methods as such found: 'strn' versions of functions to enforce checked maximum boundaries, use correct error checking, to limit these issues. 
You could add some checks in cases when if not needed successful termination return of simple_strtoul(). These checks, could check if * or endp would be altered *unpredictably* and hence follow proper error handling.
 
Additionally, make sure both characters placed before and after are properly checked and validated.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
Please refer to your given original code snippet:

   ...

           if (end < limit && *end == ':') {
                end++;
                p = simple_strtoul(end, (char **)&end, 10);

    ...

           if (*c == ':') {
                c++;
                p = simple_strtoul(c, (char **)&c, 10);
        
Please also keep in mind while fixing them make sure others potential fixes in their own implementation would ensure different coding approach than above.
