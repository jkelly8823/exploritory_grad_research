VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of an interrupt handler function for a network driver. The code is checking for pending interrupts and taking action based on the current state of the system. There is no obvious vulnerability present in this code snippet, such as user input being used without validation, out of bounds array indexing, or use of deprecated functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary in this code snippet. However, as a best practice, it is recommended to validate function return values and check for potential error conditions.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (!ath9k_hw_intrpend(ah))
	return IRQ_NONE;

if (test_bit(SC_OP_HW_RESET, &sc->sc_flags)) {
	ath9k_hw_kill_interrupts(ah);
	return IRQ_HANDLED;
}
