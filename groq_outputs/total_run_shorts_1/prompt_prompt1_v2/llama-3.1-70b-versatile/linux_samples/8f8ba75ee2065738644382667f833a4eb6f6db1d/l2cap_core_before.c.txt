VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential memory leak or resource leak due to lack of paired release or uninitialization in `hci_conn_hold`.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, `hci_conn_hold` is used to increase the connection reference count, which is often used to prevent a connection from being released or destroyed prematurely. However, there is no corresponding `hci_conn_put` to decrease the connection reference count when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak or resource leak if the connection is not properly released.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a corresponding `hci_conn_put` should be called when the connection is no longer needed to properly release the connection resource and prevent memory leaks. It is essential to maintain a balanced pair of `hci_conn_hold` and `hci_conn_put` to ensure proper connection management.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	sk = chan->sk;

	hci_conn_hold(conn->hcon);

	bacpy(&bt_sk(sk)->src, conn->src);
	bacpy(&bt_sk(sk)->dst, conn->dst);
