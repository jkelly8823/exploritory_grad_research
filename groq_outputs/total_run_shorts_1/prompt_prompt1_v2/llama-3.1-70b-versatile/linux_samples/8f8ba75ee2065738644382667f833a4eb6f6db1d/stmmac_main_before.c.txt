VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Resource Leak and Error Handling Issue

EXPLANATION:
The code checks if `clk_get` returns an error and logs a warning if it does. However, despite logging a warning, the code continues to execute on an error path, which means that other resources may still be allocated and may not be properly released in case of an error. The `goto error_clk_get` statement suggests that error handling code exists elsewhere in the function. However, it is possible that the error handling code might not release all resources allocated before the error occurred. Furthermore, the fact that an error is encountered getting a clock suggests that the system may be in an unknown or unstable state. Continuing to execute code in such a state may lead to further errors or resource leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should ensure that all resources allocated before the error are properly released, even if `clk_get` fails. This can be achieved by checking the return value of `clk_get` and calling the appropriate cleanup functions in case of an error. Additionally, the code should consider propagating the error to the caller or taking alternative actions to recover from the error, rather than simply logging a warning.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	/goto error_netdev_register;
	}

(priv->stmmac_clk = clk_get(priv->device, NULL);
	ief (IS_ERR(priv->stmmac_clk)) {
		pr_warning("%s: warning: cannot get CSR clock\n", __func__);
		goto error_clk_get;
	}
