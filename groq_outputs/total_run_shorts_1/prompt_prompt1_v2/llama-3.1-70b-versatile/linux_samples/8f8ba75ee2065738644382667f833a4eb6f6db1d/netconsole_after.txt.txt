ORIGINAL CODE:
initialized and attempts to bring up the supplied dev at the supplied
address.

The remote host has several options to receive the kernel messages,
for example:

1) syslogd

2) netcat

   On distributions using a BSD-based netcat version (e.g. Fedora,
   openSUSE and Ubuntu) the listening port must be specified without
   the -p switch:

   'nc -u -l -p <port>' / 'nc -u -l <port>' or
   'netcat -u -l -p <port>' / 'netcat -u -l <port>'

3) socat

   'socat udp-recv:<port> -'
