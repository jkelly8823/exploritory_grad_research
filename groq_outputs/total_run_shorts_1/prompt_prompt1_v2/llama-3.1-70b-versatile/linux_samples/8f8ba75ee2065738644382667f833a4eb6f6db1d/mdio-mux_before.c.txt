VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Unchecked return value of a critical function call.
EXPLANATION:
 The 'of_property_read_u32' function call on line 5 has an unchecked return value. This function is used to read a property from a device node, and its return value indicates whether the operation was successful. If the operation fails, 'of_property_read_u32' will return an error code. In this case, the return value 'r' is checked, but the error path is not properly handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
 To fix this vulnerability, we should properly handle the return value of 'of_property_read_u32'. This can be done by checking the return value against known error codes and handling each case accordingly. It's also a good practice to log the error and provide as much context as possible.
 
 For example:

```c
r = of_property_read_u32(child_bus_node, "reg", &v);
if (r) {
    pr_err("Failed to read reg property from node %pOFn\n",
            child_bus_node);
    goto err_out;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
pb->mii_bus = parent_bus;

ret_val = -ENODEV;
for_each_child_of_node(dev->of_node, child_bus_node) {
    u32 v;

    r = of_property_read_u32(child_bus_node, "reg", &v);
    if (r)
```
