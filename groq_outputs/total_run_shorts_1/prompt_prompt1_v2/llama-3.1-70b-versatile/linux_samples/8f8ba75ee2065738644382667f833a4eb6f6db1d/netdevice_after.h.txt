VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
None identified

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a part of a structure definition in C, defining function pointers for various network-related operations. Upon analyzing the provided code, I did not identify any potential vulnerabilities. The functions are defined correctly with prototypes and return types. There are no obvious buffer overflows, pointer dereferences, or potential memory leaks in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#ifdef CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER

	int			(*ndo_netpoll_setup)(struct net_device *dev,
						     struct netpoll_info *info,
						     gfp_t gfp);
	void			(*ndo_netpoll_cleanup)(struct net_device *dev);
#endif
