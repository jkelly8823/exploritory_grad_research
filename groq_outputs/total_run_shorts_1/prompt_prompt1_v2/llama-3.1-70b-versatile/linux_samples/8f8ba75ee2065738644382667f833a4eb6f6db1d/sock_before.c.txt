VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a memory disclosure vulnerability due to the lack of proper bounds checking before copying data to user space.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `copy_to_user` function to copy data from the `sec` variable to user space. However, the bounds checking performed by the `min_t` function is insufficient to prevent memory disclosure. The `sec` variable is copied to user space without any validation to ensure that its contents are not sensitive. Additionally, the `len` variable is not checked to ensure that it is within valid bounds, allowing an attacker to potentially read outside the intended buffer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, additional bounds checking and validation should be performed on the `sec` variable and the `len` variable. Specifically:
- Validate the `len` variable to ensure that it is within valid bounds and does not exceed the size of the `sec` buffer.
- Validate the contents of the `sec` buffer to ensure that they do not contain sensitive information.
- Consider using more secure functions for copying data to user space, such as `put_user` or `_put_user`.
- It is also recommended to sanitize the data before passing it to user space.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	BT_DBG("sock %p, sk %p", sock, sk);

	sa->rc_family  = AF_BLUETOOTH;
	sa->rc_channel = rfcomm_pi(sk)->channel;
	if (peer)
		bacpy(&sa->rc_bdaddr, &bt_sk(sk)->dst);
		}

		sec.level = rfcomm_pi(sk)->sec_level;

		len = min_t(unsigned int, len, sizeof(sec));
		if (copy_to_user(optval, (char *) &sec, len))
			err = -EFAULT;
