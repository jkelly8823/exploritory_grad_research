VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability in `sprintf` function

EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf` function is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks because it does not check the length of the output string. If the string "usb#%d" and the value of `kingsun->usbdev->devnum` are too long, they will exceed the allocated buffer size of `hwname`, leading to a buffer overflow. This could allow an attacker to corrupt memory and potentially execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use `snprintf` instead of `sprintf` to prevent buffer overflow. This function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to write to the buffer, preventing overflow. The corrected line would be:

`snprintf(hwname, sizeof(hwname), "usb#%d", kingsun->usbdev->devnum);`

Additionally, consider using `strcpy` or `strncpy` instead of `sprintf` if you only need to copy a fixed string to the buffer.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
    sprintf(hwname, "usb#%d", kingsun->usbdev->devnum);
    kingsun->irlap = irlap_open(netdev, &kingsun->qos, hwname);
    if (!kingsun->irlap) {
        dev_err(&kingsun->usbdev->dev, "irlap_open failed\n");
        goto free_mem;
    }
```
