VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Double-Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a kernel module. In this snippet, memory is reallocated using `krealloc` for the `pmkids` structure. However, if the reallocation fails, the code still increments and updates the `pmkids->bssid_info_count` and `pmkids->length` values. This can lead to a double-free vulnerability when the code later tries to free the `pmkids` structure. This vulnerability is present because when the reallocation fails, the original `pmkids` structure is not updated correctly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, update the `pmkids` structure with the new length and count only after a successful reallocation. In case of failure, do not update the `pmkids` structure. Here is a corrected version of the code:
```c
new_pmkids = krealloc(pmkids, newlen, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!new_pmkids) {
	err = -ENOMEM;
	goto error;
} else {
	pmkids = new_pmkids;
	pmkids->length = cpu_to_le32(newlen);
	pmkids->bssid_info_count = cpu_to_le32(count + 1);
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
					struct cfg80211_pmksa *pmksa,
					int max_pmkids)
{
	struct ndis_80211_pmkid *new_pmkids;
	int i, err, newlen;
	unsigned int count;

	count = le32_to_cpu(pmkids->bssid_info_count);
	/* add new pmkid */
	newlen = sizeof(*pmkids) + (count + 1) * sizeof(pmkids->bssid_info[0]);

	new_pmkids = krealloc(pmkids, newlen, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!new_pmkids) {
		err = -ENOMEM;
		goto error;
	}
	pmkids = new_pmkids;

	pmkids->length = cpu_to_le32(newlen);
	pmkids->bssid_info_count = cpu_to_le32(count + 1);
```
