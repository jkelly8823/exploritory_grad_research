VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No security vulnerability was detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a declaration of an array of structures that contain USB device information, including the vendor and product IDs. There is no obvious security vulnerability present in this code. The `.driver_info` field seems to be set to a constant value, which is likely a magic number or a pre-defined constant in the driver.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A

ORIGINAL CODE:
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0cf3, 0xe004), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 },
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0cf3, 0xe005), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 },
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0930, 0x0219), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 },
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0930, 0x0220), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 },
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0489, 0xe057), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 },
    { USB_DEVICE(0x13d3, 0x3393), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 },
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0489, 0xe04e), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 },
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0489, 0xe056), .driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012 }
