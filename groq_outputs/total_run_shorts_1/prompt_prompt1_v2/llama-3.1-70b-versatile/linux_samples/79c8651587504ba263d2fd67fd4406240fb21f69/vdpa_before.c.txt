VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer overflow vulnerability in fixed-size integer types.
EXPLANATION:
On line 2, we see `NLA_POLICY_MIN(NLA_U16, 68)`, which specifies the minimum valid value for the MTU configuration. However, `NLA_U16` indicates that it is a 16-bit unsigned integer. In most systems, the maximum MTU value for Ethernet frames (1522 bytes) is closer to this maximum. However, there is an unsigned 16-bit integer `u16` which will likely be used to store this value, which is also capable of storing 65535. Should this value be somehow manipulated to be above the anticipated MTU limit, this opens the possibility of overflow elsewhere, potentially leading to exploitation. Mitigation strategies can minimize the attack surface by reducing this attack vector's exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use `u32` instead of `u16` wherever applicable to significantly reduce the risk of overflow. Moreover, include additional error checking when data is accepted from potentially untrusted sources.
