RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static void mt76_rx_release_amsdu(struct mt76_phy *phy, enum mt76_rxq_id q)
{
	struct sk_buff *skb = phy->rx_amsdu[q].head;
	struct mt76_dev *dev = phy->dev;

	phy->rx_amsdu[q].head = NULL;
	phy->rx_amsdu[q].tail = NULL;
	__skb_queue_tail(&dev->rx_skb[q], skb);
}
