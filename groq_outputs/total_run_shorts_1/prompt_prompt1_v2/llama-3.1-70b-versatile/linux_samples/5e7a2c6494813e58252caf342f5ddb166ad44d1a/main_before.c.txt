VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of a driver or firmware implementation for handling IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. It is setting specific PHY (physical layer) capability information in the `he_cap_elem` structure. The code checks the band (2.4GHz or 5GHz) and sets corresponding channel width and modulation coding scheme capabilities. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the given code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were found.
