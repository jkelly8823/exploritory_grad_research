VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 56-59
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential memory corruption vulnerability. In the mt76x0e_register_device function, the line 'mt76_free_device(mdev);' is called after an object is used with the functions mt76_pci_disable_aspm and mt76_alloc_device. This can cause a potential use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises due to the way memory is managed for the 'mdev' object. The object is allocated using 'mt76_alloc_device' and then used in subsequent function calls. However, the object is then deallocated using 'mt76_free_device' before these function calls have completed. This can lead to a situation where the object is accessed after it has been freed, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the 'mt76_free_device(mdev);' line should be moved to after the 'if (ret); return ret;' statement, ensuring that the object is not accessed after it has been freed. 
The corrected code should look like this:

```c
static int mt76x0e_register_device(struct mt76x02_dev *dev)
{
    ...
    if (ret)
        return ret;
    mt76_free_device(mdev); // Move this line here
    ...
}
```
