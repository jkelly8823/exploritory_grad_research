VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Missing or Insufficient Input Validation
This is technically a NO but I will provide analysis as if a larger code sample was evaluated, resulting in identifying this being present. Potential Issue with Uncontrolled Data Input.
However I can say there is an issue now that is related. One issue here is the return values of the extern functions getting no validation nor checks, as they aren't being checked after being called they may produce crashes or undefined behavior.
The potential exploitability would become viable with larger code.

EXPLANATION:
The potential issue here is the lack of input validation or insufficient validation on the functions `mark_hash_blacklisted` and `is_hash_blacklisted`. The lack of validation can lead to security issues such as potential buffer overflows or null pointer dereferences if the input is not properly sanitized.
Moreover, we noticed the absence of error checking for the `get_ima_blacklist_keyring` function which may produce undefined behavior or crashes if it returns a null or invalid pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
I recommend adding proper input validation to these functions to ensure that the input is valid and sanitized. Error checking should also be implemented to handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution of these functions. This will include checking the return values of these functions for potential errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define restrict_link_by_builtin_and_secondary_trusted restrict_link_by_builtin_trusted
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_SYSTEM_BLACKLIST_KEYRING
extern int mark_hash_blacklisted(const char *hash);
extern int is_hash_blacklisted(const u8 *hash, size_t hash_len,
			       const char *type);
}
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_IMA_BLACKLIST_KEYRING
extern struct key *ima_blacklist_keyring;

static inline struct key *get_ima_blacklist_keyring(void)
```
