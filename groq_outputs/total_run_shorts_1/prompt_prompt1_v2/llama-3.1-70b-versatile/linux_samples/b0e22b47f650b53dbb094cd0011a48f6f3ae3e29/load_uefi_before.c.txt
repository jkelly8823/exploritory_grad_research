VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unconditional kfree() without proper check for NULL pointer dereference and premature deallocation.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a vulnerability where `dbx` is being deallocated using `kfree()` without checking if it's actually pointing to a valid memory location. The check `if (!efi_rt_services_supported(EFI_RT_SUPPORTED_GET_VARIABLE))` does not guarantee that `dbx` has been initialized before reaching this point. Additionally, there's no apparent allocation for `dbx` within the provided snippet, which makes the kfree() call potentially problematic.

Furthermore, if `dbx` was indeed allocated elsewhere, deallocating it here might lead to issues later on if other parts of the code still hold references to the memory location.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Before calling `kfree()`, the `dbx` pointer should be checked for NULL to prevent a potential NULL pointer dereference. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that `dbx` is not accessed later on after being deallocated.

Corrected code snippet should be:
```c
if (dbx != NULL && !efi_rt_services_supported(EFI_RT_SUPPORTED_GET_VARIABLE)) {
    kfree(dbx);
    dbx = NULL;  // Reset dbx to NULL after deallocation
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int __init load_uefi_certs(void)
{
    efi_guid_t secure_var = EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE_GUID;
    void *db = NULL, *dbx = NULL;
    unsigned long dbsize = 0, dbxsize = 0;
    efi_status_t status;
    int rc = 0;

    if (!efi_rt_services_supported(EFI_RT_SUPPORTED_GET_VARIABLE))
    kfree(dbx);
    }

    /* Load the MokListRT certs */
    rc = load_moklist_certs();

    return rc;
}
```
