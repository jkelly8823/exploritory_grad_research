VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains an insufficient validation of trusted keys. It only checks if the key is on the revocation list and then calls `pkcs7_validate_trust()`, but it does not properly handle cases where the key is not trusted or is missing.

EXPLANATION:
The code does not provide adequate checks to ensure the trusted keys are properly validated. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where a key is missing (`-ENOKEY` error) or when `pkcs7_validate_trust()` returns an error. In these cases, the code jumps to the `error` label but does not log the error details. This could potentially lead to unintentional behavior if an untrusted key is used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Properly handle cases where the key is not trusted or is missing by logging the error details and providing a safe fallback. For example, if `pkcs7_validate_trust()` fails, log the error using `pr_err()` and return an error code.

Consider modifying the code to:
```c
ret = pkcs7_validate_trust(pkcs7, trusted_keys);
if (ret < 0) {
    if (ret == -ENOKEY) {
        pr_err("Trusted key not found\n");
    } else {
        pr_err("Failed to validate trusted key: %d\n", ret);
    }
    goto error;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <keys/asymmetric-type.h>
#include <keys/system_keyring.h>
#include <crypto/pkcs7.h>
#include "common.h"

static struct key *builtin_trusted_keys;
#ifdef CONFIG_SECONDARY_TRUSTED_KEYRING
static struct key *secondary_trusted_keys;
 */
static __init int load_system_certificate_list(void)
{
    pr_notice("Loading compiled-in X.509 certificates\n");

    return load_certificate_list(system_certificate_list, system_certificate_list_size,
                                 builtin_trusted_keys);
}
late_initcall(load_system_certificate_list);

#ifdef CONFIG_SYSTEM_DATA_VERIFICATION
            pr_devel("PKCS#7 platform keyring is not available\n");
            goto error;
        }

        ret = is_key_on_revocation_list(pkcs7);
        if (ret != -ENOKEY) {
            pr_devel("PKCS#7 platform key is on revocation list\n");
            goto error;
        }
    }
    ret = pkcs7_validate_trust(pkcs7, trusted_keys);
    if (ret < 0) {
        if (ret == -ENOKEY)
```
