VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
None

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet includes necessary header files for a Linux kernel module, specifically relating to cryptography. It also declares an extern array of constant strings, `blacklist_hashes`. However, after analyzing the given code snippet, no potential vulnerabilities or insecure practices have been found. As this snippet is likely part of a larger codebase and appears to follow proper conventions for declaring external variables and including required headers, it is unlikely to introduce any security risks on its own.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities were found. However, it is essential to ensure that the rest of the codebase utilizing the `blacklist_hashes` array handles memory management correctly and does not introduce any potential buffer overflows or memory leaks when working with these strings.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/errno.h>
#include <crypto/pkcs7.h>

extern const char __initconst *const blacklist_hashes[];
