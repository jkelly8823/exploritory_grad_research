VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use After Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The potential vulnerability is present on lines 5-6. The function call to `efi_rt_services_supported` seems to return a boolean value, yet the code checks for a specific supported service. However, if this service is not supported, it immediately calls `kfree(dbx)`, but `dbx` is only initialized to `NULL` earlier. There is no evidence of `dbx` being allocated memory prior to this point. Freeing a null pointer will typically not result in an error but could potentially result in undefined behavior depending on the system's libc implementation. However, a more serious problem presents if the intention was to initialize `dbx` before this check and a code modification error resulted in `dbx` initialization being removed.

The presence of a real vulnerability depends on whether `dbx` is intended to be allocated memory before this point and an initialization of `dbx` was simply removed, but if such an initialization existed or if it's implemented in code which is processed prior to hitting this, this block could be vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Verify that `dbx` is correctly initialized prior to this check. 
It is recommended that debugging statements are placed before the check to verify the value of `dbx`. 

Modify the code as follows:

```c
if (!efi_rt_services_supported(EFI_RT_SUPPORTED_GET_VARIABLE)) {
	/* verify dbx has a valid value here */
	if (dbx != NULL) {
        kfree(dbx);
    }
    /* Handle the unsupported service error here, return value, etc */	
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
static int __init load_uefi_certs(void)
{
	efi_guid_t secure_var = EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE_GUID;
	efi_guid_t mok_var = EFI_SHIM_LOCK_GUID;
	void *db = NULL, *dbx = NULL, *mokx = NULL;
	unsigned long dbsize = 0, dbxsize = 0, mokxsize = 0;
	efi_status_t status;
	int rc = 0;

	if (!efi_rt_services_supported(EFI_RT_SUPPORTED_GET_VARIABLE))
		kfree(dbx);
	}

	mokx = get_cert_list(L"MokListXRT", &mok_var, &mokxsize, &status);
	if (!mokx) {
		if (status == EFI_NOT_FOUND)
			pr_debug("mokx variable wasn't found\n");
		else
			pr_info("Couldn't get mokx list\n");
	} else {
		rc = parse_efi_signature_list("UEFI:MokListXRT",
					      mokx, mokxsize,
					      get_handler_for_dbx);
		if (rc)
			pr_err("Couldn't parse mokx signatures %d\n", rc);
		kfree(mokx);
	}

	/* Load the MokListRT certs */
	rc = load_moklist_certs();

	return rc;
}
```
