VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No specific security vulnerability detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver, likely used in a Linux kernel. It checks if `drm_vblank_init()` has been called before attempting to use `dev->num_crtcs`, which suggests a potential issue with the use of uninitialized data. However, the code includes a proper check for this condition and skips the rest of the function if `num_crtcs` is zero, effectively preventing the use of uninitialized data.

Although this code snippet seems to be missing some required variable declarations (like `dev`), this does not imply a vulnerability in and of itself.  Also note that `drm_vblank_init()` should be designed to return non-zero when it succeeds, so there seems no possibility of accessing data without having initialized it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None applicable. The check in place ensures that the method skips its execution if the `drm_vblank_init()` hasn't been invoked yet.

ORIGINAL CODE:

			struct drm_file *file_priv)
{
	struct drm_modeset_ctl *modeset = data;
	int crtc, ret = 0;

	/* If drm_vblank_init() hasn't been called yet, just no-op */
	if (!dev->num_crtcs)
		goto out;
