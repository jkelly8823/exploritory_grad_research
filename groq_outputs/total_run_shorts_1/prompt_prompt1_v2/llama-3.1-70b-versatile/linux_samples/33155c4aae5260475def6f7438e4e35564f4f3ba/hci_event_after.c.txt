VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use after free vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION:
The code calls `hci_conn_drop(conn)` twice. The first call to `hci_conn_drop(conn)` suggests that the connection is being released, which likely involves deallocating the memory used by `conn`. However, the code then calls `hdev` and `hci_conn_drop(conn)` again after releasing `conn`. If `hci_conn_drop(conn)` does indeed deallocate `conn`, then accessing `conn` in the lines following its first release results in use after free.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of calling `hci_conn_drop(conn)` twice, it is recommended to call it only once when the connection is actually supposed to be released. The lines that call `hdev` and the second `hci_conn_drop(conn)` should be executed before the first call to `hci_conn_drop(conn)`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	if (!conn)
		goto unlock;

	/* Ignore NULL link key against CVE-2020-26555 */
	if (!memcmp(ev->link_key, ZERO_KEY, HCI_LINK_KEY_SIZE)) {
		bt_dev_dbg(hdev, "Ignore NULL link key (ZERO KEY) for %pMR",
			   &ev->bdaddr);
		hci_disconnect(conn, HCI_ERROR_AUTH_FAILURE);
		hci_conn_drop(conn);
		goto unlock;
	}

	hci_conn_hold(conn);
	conn->disc_timeout = HCI_DISCONN_TIMEOUT;
	hci_conn_drop(conn);
```
