ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
# define _ASM_EXTABLE_EX(from, to)				\
	_ASM_EXTABLE_HANDLE(from, to, ex_handler_ext)

# define _ASM_NOKPROBE(entry)					\
	.pushsection "_kprobe_blacklist","aw" ;			\
	_ASM_ALIGN ;						\
	_ASM_PTR (entry);					\
# define _ASM_EXTABLE_EX(from, to)				\
	_ASM_EXTABLE_HANDLE(from, to, ex_handler_ext)

/* For C file, we already have NOKPROBE_SYMBOL macro */
#endif

#endif /* _ASM_X86_ASM_H */
