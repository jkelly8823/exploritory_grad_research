VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be a series of macros for the Linux kernel, written in assembly language. The macros define several exception tables and exception handlers. Upon analyzing the code, I did not identify any potential vulnerabilities. The macros seem to follow best practices for defining and using exceptions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerability is present, no fixes are recommended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
# define _ASM_EXTABLE_EX(from, to)				\
	_ASM_EXTABLE_HANDLE(from, to, ex_handler_ext)

# define _ASM_EXTABLE_REFCOUNT(from, to)			\
	_ASM_EXTABLE_HANDLE(from, to, ex_handler_refcount)

# define _ASM_NOKPROBE(entry)					\
	.pushsection "_kprobe_blacklist","aw" ;			\
	_ASM_ALIGN ;						\
	_ASM_PTR (entry);					\
# define _ASM_EXTABLE_EX(from, to)				\
	_ASM_EXTABLE_HANDLE(from, to, ex_handler_ext)

# define _ASM_EXTABLE_REFCOUNT(from, to)			\
	_ASM_EXTABLE_HANDLE(from, to, ex_handler_refcount)

/* For C file, we already have NOKPROBE_SYMBOL macro */
#endif

#endif /* _ASM_X86_ASM_H */
```
