VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, no vulnerabilities were detected. The code snippet appears to be function declarations and does not contain any vulnerable operations such as input validation, memory management, or sensitive data handling. The functions declared seem to be related to parsing strings to unsigned integers or long integers, but no implementation is provided, which is not sufficient to introduce a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_exit(long error_code) __noreturn;
void complete_and_exit(struct completion *, long) __noreturn;

/* Internal, do not use. */
int __must_check _kstrtoul(const char *s, unsigned int base, unsigned long *res);
int __must_check _kstrtol(const char *s, unsigned int base, long *res);
```
