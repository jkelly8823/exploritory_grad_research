VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a definition of an enumeration (`enum netlink_skb_flags`) and a structure (`struct netlink_skb_parms`). The enumeration defines flags for netlink skb (socket buffer) packets, while the structure contains credentials for skb packets. There are no obvious vulnerabilities or red flags in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
enum netlink_skb_flags {
	NETLINK_SKB_MMAPED	= 0x1,		/* Packet data is mmaped */
	NETLINK_SKB_TX		= 0x2,		/* Packet was sent by userspace */
	NETLINK_SKB_DELIVERED	= 0x4,		/* Packet was delivered */
};

struct netlink_skb_parms {
	struct scm_creds	creds;		/* Skb credentials	*/
```
