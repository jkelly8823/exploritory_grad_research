VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Use After Free vulnerability in the error handling of realloc_context_ids() function.

EXPLANATION:
In the error handling of the realloc_context_ids() function, we have a potential use after free situation. When an error occurs in the allocation of a new context id, the code frees up the already allocated context ids, but does not reset the corresponding pointers in the ctx->extended_id array. However, the return statement at the end of the function includes 'return id;' where id is not guaranteed to contain a valid context id, because the previous id allocation failed, and 'id' may still hold a stale value which could lead to use after free problems.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should initialize 'id' to -1 before the loop starts. If an error occurs, it will then return -1 instead of a stale context id.

Alternatively, we could remove the line 'return id;' from the error handling and instead call the function to reclaim id with id = -1 to prevent the incorrect context id from being returned.
