VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of `crypto_memneq` function for comparing secret values.
EXPLANATION:
This code uses `crypto_memneq` function for comparing secret values (digests), which is the correct function to use. However, it might not be suitable in a performance-critical context due to its variable-time comparison. It is worth considering using the `crypto_memcmp` function with a constant-time comparison in addition to the timing attack prevention provided by `crypto_memneq`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Although `crypto_memneq` is being correctly used here, to prevent timing attacks, consider using a constant-time comparison function that also checks the size of the values being compared. You could enhance this by using `crypto_memcmp` in conjunction with a constant-time comparison check to prevent any potential side channel attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/integrity.h>
#include <linux/evm.h>
#include <crypto/hash.h>
#include <crypto/algapi.h>
#include "evm.h"

int evm_initialized;

				   xattr_value_len, calc.digest);
		if (rc)
			break;
		rc = crypto_memneq(xattr_data->digest, calc.digest,
			    sizeof(calc.digest));
		if (rc)
			rc = -EINVAL;
		break;
