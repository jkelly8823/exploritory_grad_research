VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 7, 8, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of freed memory through dangling pointers.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the `cfg->wiphy` is freed at line 6 (`brcmf_free_wiphy(cfg->wiphy);`), but before this, lines 7-9 use this freed memory. Specifically, line 7 uses `cfg->wiphy` to call `wiphy_unregister(cfg->wiphy)`, and then line 8 uses another freed memory (`cfg`) to call `wl_deinit_priv(cfg)` and line 9 again uses a freed memory (`cfg`) to call `cancel_work_sync(&cfg->escan_timeout_work)`. Finally, at line 10, `cfg` is freed itself (`kfree(cfg)`), but after being used in lines 7-9.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
These issues can be resolved by rearranging the code so that the `cfg->wiphy` and `cfg` are not used after being freed. The correct sequence of free operations is crucial. To correct this, move `wiphy_unregister(cfg->wiphy)` before `brcmf_free_wiphy(cfg->wiphy)`, and move `wl_deinit_priv(cfg)` and `cancel_work_sync(&cfg->escan_timeout_work)` before `kfree(cfg)`.

Here's a suggested corrected version:

```c
scan_request = cfg->scan_request;
cfg->scan_request = NULL;

timer_delete_sync(&cfg->escan_timeout);

if (fw_abort) {
    /* Do a scan abort to stop the driver's scan engine */
    brcmf_dbg(SCAN, "ABORT scan in firmware\n");
    wiphy_unregister(cfg->wiphy);  // unregister before free
    brcmf_free_wiphy(cfg->wiphy);
    wl_deinit_priv(cfg);  // deinit before free
    cancel_work_sync(&cfg->escan_timeout_work);  // cancel work before free
    brcmf_btcoex_detach(cfg);
    kfree(cfg);  // Now safe to free
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
    scan_request = cfg->scan_request;
    cfg->scan_request = NULL;

    timer_delete_sync(&cfg->escan_timeout);

    if (fw_abort) {
        /* Do a scan abort to stop the driver's scan engine */
        brcmf_dbg(SCAN, "ABORT scan in firmware\n");
        brcmf_btcoex_detach(cfg);
        wiphy_unregister(cfg->wiphy);
        wl_deinit_priv(cfg);
        cancel_work_sync(&cfg->escan_timeout_work);
        brcmf_free_wiphy(cfg->wiphy);
        kfree(cfg);
    }
