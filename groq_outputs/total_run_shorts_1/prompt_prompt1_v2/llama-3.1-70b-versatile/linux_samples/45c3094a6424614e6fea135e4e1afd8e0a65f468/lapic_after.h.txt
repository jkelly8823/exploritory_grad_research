VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Bit shift operation can lead to undefined behavior when the shift amount is greater than the number of bits in the type of the value being shifted.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains a line `ldr >>= 32 - map->ldr_bits;` which performs a right shift operation. However, this operation can potentially lead to undefined behavior if the value of `map->ldr_bits` is greater than 32. This is because the C standard states that shifting a value by a number of bits greater than or equal to the number of bits in the type of the value being shifted is undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the shift amount is not greater than the number of bits in the type of the value being shifted. This can be done by adding a conditional statement before performing the shift operation.

```c
if (map->ldr_bits <= 32 && 32 - map->ldr_bits >= 0) {
    ldr >>= 32 - map->ldr_bits;
} else {
    // Handle error or undefined behavior
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
ldr >>= 32 - map->ldr_bits;
cid = (ldr >> map->cid_shift) & map->cid_mask;

return cid;
}

static inline u16 apic_logical_id(struct kvm_apic_map *map, u32 ldr)
