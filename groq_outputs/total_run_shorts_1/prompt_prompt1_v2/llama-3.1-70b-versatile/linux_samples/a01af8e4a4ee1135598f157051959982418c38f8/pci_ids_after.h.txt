VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet consists of preprocessor directives defining constants for PCI device IDs, subdevice IDs, and vendor IDs. These definitions are standard and safe. There are no executable code paths, variable assignments, or function calls that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. The definitions are straightforward, and the constants do not seem to be used in a context that would lead to any security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were detected in this code.
