VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability identified.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines several constants using the `#define` preprocessor directive. These constants appear to be related to PCI device IDs and vendor IDs. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code.

The constants defined in this code are not used to execute any potentially vulnerable operations (e.g., processing untrusted input, allocating memory, executing system commands). They appear to be simple preprocessor definitions for PCI device identification.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
