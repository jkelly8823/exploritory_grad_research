VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated errors lead to insufficient error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code in question does not validate all possible error codes after calling blkdev_issue_discard(). If blkdev_issue_discard() returns an error other than -EOPNOTSUPP, the status is set to BLKIF_RSP_OKAY which is an inconsistent and possibly misleading response to an error.

This is an issue because if the caller of this function then interprets a status of BLKIF_RSP_OKAY as a successful discard operation when in fact it failed. The caller may then believe the data to be properly discarded and continue to execute operations based on that assumption, when in fact the data may still be present on disk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider storing the original status and only updating it when there's an error. Ensure that all error codes from blkdev_issue_discard() are properly checked for and appropriate status values are set.

Here's an updated version of a portion of the code:

```c
int status = BLKIF_RSP_OKAY;
err = blkdev_issue_discard(bdev, req->u.discard.sector_number,
                           req->u.discard.nr_sectors,
                           GFP_KERNEL, secure);
if (err) {
    status = BLKIF_RSP_ERROR;  // Update status when an error occurs
    pr_warn(DRV_PFX "discard op failed, error: %d\n", err);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int status = BLKIF_RSP_OKAY;
struct block_device *bdev = blkif->vbd.bdev;
unsigned long secure;
struct phys_req preq;

preq.sector_number = req->u.discard.sector_number;
preq.nr_sects      = req->u.discard.nr_sectors;

err = xen_vbd_translate(&preq, blkif, WRITE);
if (err) {
    pr_warn(DRV_PFX "access denied: DISCARD [%llu->%llu] on dev=%04x\n",
        preq.sector_number,
        preq.sector_number + preq.nr_sects, blkif->vbd.pdevice);
    goto fail_response;
}
blkif->st_ds_req++;

xen_blkif_get(blkif);
secure = (blkif->vbd.discard_secure &&
err = blkdev_issue_discard(bdev, req->u.discard.sector_number,
                   req->u.discard.nr_sectors,
                   GFP_KERNEL, secure);
fail_response:
if (err == -EOPNOTSUPP) {
    pr_debug(DRV_PFX "discard op failed, not supported\n");
    status = BLKIF_RSP_EOPNOTSUPP;
} else if (err)
```
