VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
There are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a routine that initializes an NFC socket. It checks for memory allocation failures and handles potential collisions by freeing memory and returning an appropriate error code. There are no obvious signs of buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other common vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are available for this code snippet. However, to further harden this code, consider adding additional error checking for potential failure conditions (e.g., check `llcp_sock` for null pointer dereferences) and ensuring that all memory is properly freed in all possible code paths.
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
llcp_sock->service_name = kmalloc(llcp_sock->service_name_len, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!llcp_sock->service_name) {
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto put_dev;
}
llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock);
if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {
    kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);
    llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;
    ret = -EADDRINUSE;
    goto put_dev;
}
