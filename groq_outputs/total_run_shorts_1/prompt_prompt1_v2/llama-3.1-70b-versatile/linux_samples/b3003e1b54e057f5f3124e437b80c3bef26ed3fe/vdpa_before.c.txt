VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet defines an array of NLA policies and a structure of genl_ops. No obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or use-after-free conditions, were detected in this code. The data types and constants used are also well-defined and appear to be used correctly. As the snippet appears to be a definitions snippet, there is a lack of dynamic variable usage which limits the chances for vulnerabilities here.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. Based on the given code, no vulnerabilities were detected. However, it would be good practice to review the full project to ensure that the defined constants and structures are used safely and correctly throughout the codebase.
ORIGINAL CODE:
