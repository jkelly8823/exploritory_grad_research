VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
There are no identified vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet consists of function declarations for hci_uart related operations. The functions seem to be properly defined and there are no evident signs of security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, command injections, data leaks, etc. Since this code snippet only contains function declarations and does not include any executable code, it is hard to identify vulnerabilities without the implementation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are required for this code snippet as it appears to be safe and secure.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int hci_uart_init_ready(struct hci_uart *hu);
void hci_uart_init_work(struct work_struct *work);
void hci_uart_set_baudrate(struct hci_uart *hu, unsigned int speed);
bool hci_uart_has_flow_control(struct hci_uart *hu);
void hci_uart_set_flow_control(struct hci_uart *hu, bool enable);
void hci_uart_set_speeds(struct hci_uart *hu, unsigned int init_speed,
			 unsigned int oper_speed);
