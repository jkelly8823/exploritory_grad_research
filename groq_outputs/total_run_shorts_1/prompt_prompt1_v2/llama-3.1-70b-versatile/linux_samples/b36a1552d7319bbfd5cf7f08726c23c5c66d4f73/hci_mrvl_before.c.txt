VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a kernel module or driver, and it seems to be properly allocating memory for a structure using `kzalloc`. The function checks for memory allocation failure and returns an error code if it occurs, which is a good practice.

In general, vulnerabilities often arise from incorrect handling of user input, usage of vulnerable functions, or memory management issues. However, in this specific code snippet, we don't see any obvious signs of these types of issues. The code seems to be following standard Linux kernel coding practices.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:

	BT_DBG("hu %p", hu);

	mrvl = kzalloc(sizeof(*mrvl), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!mrvl)
		return -ENOMEM;
