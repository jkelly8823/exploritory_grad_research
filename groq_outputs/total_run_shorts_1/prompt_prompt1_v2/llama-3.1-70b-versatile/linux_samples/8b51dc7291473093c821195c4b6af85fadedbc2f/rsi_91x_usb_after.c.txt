VULNERABLE: NO

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet is quite minimalistic. However, based on the information given, we can see a call to `kfree` which is a kernel function that frees previously allocated memory. Although not visible in this snippet, if `rsi_dev->tx_buffer` was not previously checked for NULL before being freed, this could potentially lead to a NULL pointer dereference. However, this can't be confirmed with the given snippet alone.

However, given the snippet is so short, it does not contain an obvious vulnerability on its own. Since we cannot confirm if `rsi_dev->tx_buffer` was not checked for NULL before being freed, I will assume there isn't an issue. It's essential to evaluate the complete function, especially the code before the given snippet to ensure memory safety.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
If `rsi_dev->tx_buffer` was not previously checked, we recommend adding a NULL pointer check before freeing the memory:

    if (rsi_dev->tx_buffer) {
    	kfree(rsi_dev->tx_buffer);
    	rsi_dev->tx_buffer = NULL; /* Avoid double free */
    }

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	kfree(rsi_dev->tx_buffer);

fail_eps:

	return status;
}
```
