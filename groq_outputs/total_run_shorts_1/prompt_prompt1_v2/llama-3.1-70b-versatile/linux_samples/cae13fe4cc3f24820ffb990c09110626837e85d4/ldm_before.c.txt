VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a function that handles list manipulation and error handling. It checks a flag (`f->map`) for a specific bit (`1 << rec`) to detect a duplicate condition, and if so, logs an error message and marks the group as broken. The code seems to handle potential errors properly, without introducing obvious vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code, as it does not present any apparent security risks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    list_add_tail (&f->list, frags);
found:
    if (f->map & (1 << rec)) {
        ldm_error ("Duplicate VBLK, part %d.", rec);
        f->map &= 0x7F;          /* Mark the group as broken */
        return false;
