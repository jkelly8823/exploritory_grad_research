VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbounded read from input file.

EXPLANATION:
The function `read_event_file` reads from a file (`pevent`) into a system context (`sys`) with a size determined by the return value of `read8(pevent)`. This size is not validated against any known limits or boundaries, allowing a potential attacker to supply an arbitrarily large size. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `sys` has a fixed size, or excessive memory allocation if `sys` is dynamically allocated. 

Additionally, there is no validation or sanitization of the input size, which could be tampered with by an attacker. This could potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input size obtained from `read8(pevent)` against a reasonable maximum limit to prevent excessive allocation or buffer overflow.
2. Implement bounds checking within `read_event_file` to ensure that the read operation does not exceed the allocated buffer size (`sys`).
3. Consider using a safe and limit-aware version of `read_event_file` if available.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	for (x=0; x < count; x++) {
		size = read8(pevent);
		ret = read_event_file(pevent, sys, size);
		if (ret)
			return ret;
	}
}
return 0;
