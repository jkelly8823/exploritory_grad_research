VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Wild character (*) usage in a system configuration file may lead to unintended system access or escalation of privileges.

EXPLANATION:
The 'create' statement specifies special privileges to all users and groups for an untrusted program `/usr/sbin/dns.foo`. The '*' wildcard character is used to grant access to all users and groups. While the intention might be to simplify configuration, this approach could allow malicious users or compromised accounts to exploit vulnerabilities in the untrusted program and gain elevated privileges.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Specific user accounts and groups should be granted access instead of using a wildcard character ('*'). This can be achieved by replacing '*' with the actual user or group names, allowing a more fine-grained access control. An example of a more secure configuration would be:
```
(create dns_resolver foo:dhcp dhcp /usr/sbin/dns.foo %k)
```
It is also recommended to consider using a minimum privilege approach, ensuring that the program runs with the least privileges necessary, to limit potential exploitation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
create dns_resolver   foo:*   *  /usr/sbin/dns.foo %k
```
