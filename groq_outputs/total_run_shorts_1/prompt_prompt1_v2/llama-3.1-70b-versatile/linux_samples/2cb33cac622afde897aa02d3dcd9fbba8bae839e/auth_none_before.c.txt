VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a struct or function implementation, likely related to authentication in a Ceph distributed file system. However, there is not enough context to identify any vulnerabilities, and the code itself does not exhibit any obvious security concerns. The code snippet does not contain any suspicious operations, such as memory access or manipulation, nor does it contain any obvious logical flaws.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary as none were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:

	return xi->starting;
}

/*
 * the generic auth code decode the global_id, and we carry no actual
 * authenticate state, so nothing happens here.
 */
