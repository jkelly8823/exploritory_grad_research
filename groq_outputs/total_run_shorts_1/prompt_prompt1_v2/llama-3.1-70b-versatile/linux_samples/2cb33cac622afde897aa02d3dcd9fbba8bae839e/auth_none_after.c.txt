VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a Ceph authentication module. It contains a struct initialization with function pointers, which are common in C programming. However, there doesn't seem to be any dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, or sensitive data handling that could lead to a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, this code appears to be secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return xi->starting;
}

static int build_request(struct ceph_auth_client *ac, void *buf, void *end)
{
	return 0;
}

/*
 * the generic auth code decode the global_id, and we carry no actual
 * authenticate state, so nothing happens here.
 */
	.destroy = destroy,
	.is_authenticated = is_authenticated,
	.should_authenticate = should_authenticate,
	.build_request = build_request,
	.handle_reply = handle_reply,
	.create_authorizer = ceph_auth_none_create_authorizer,
	.destroy_authorizer = ceph_auth_none_destroy_authorizer,
};
```

Note that this code snippet is incomplete and it's hard to make an absolute assessment without seeing the entire codebase. However, based on the given code snippet, it appears to be secure.
