VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a macro definition for a stackleak erase function. The code checks for the existence of a specific configuration (CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK) before calling the stackleak_erase function. No input validation or sanitization issues, nor potential buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities were detected. As the code is a macro definition, it's likely that variable declarations or definitions are handled elsewhere in the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it appears to be secure. However, it's essential to review the entire codebase, including the definitions of `PUSH_AND_CLEAR_REGS` and `stackleak_erase`, to ensure there are no vulnerabilities in those areas.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#endif

.macro STACKLEAK_ERASE_NOCLOBBER
#ifdef CONFIG_GCC PLUGIN STACKLEAK
	PUSH AND CLEAR REGS
	call stackleak_erase
```
