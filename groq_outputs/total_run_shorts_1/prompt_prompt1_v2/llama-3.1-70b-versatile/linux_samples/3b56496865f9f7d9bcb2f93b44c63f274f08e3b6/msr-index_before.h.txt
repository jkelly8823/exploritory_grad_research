VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a series of constants using the `#define` preprocessor directive, which is a common practice in C/C++ programming. These definitions appear to represent various MSR (Model-Specific Registers) addresses related to AMD64 architecture. Upon reviewing the code, I did not identify any potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use of sensitive data without proper validation, or execution of system commands without proper input validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, no specific recommendations are provided.
