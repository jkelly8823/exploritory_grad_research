VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of a program exception handling routine in a PowerPC-based system. It checks the SRR1 register to determine if a bad thing type program check originated from the kernel, and if so, uses an emergency stack. The code is properly checking the MSR_PR and SRR1_PROGTM bits to determine the origin of the program check and ensures proper CR0 handling before entering the macro in EXCEPTION_PROLOG_COMMON. No apparent vulnerabilities were detected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```assembly
EXC_VIRT(program_check, 0x4700, 0x100, 0x700)
TRAMP_KVM(PACA_EXGEN, 0x700)

	/*
	 * It's possible to receive a TM Bad Thing type program check with
	 * userspace register values (in particular r1), but with SRR1 reporting
	 * that we came from the kernel. Normally that would confuse the bad
	 * stack logic, and we would report a bad kernel stack pointer. Instead
	 * we switch to the emergency stack if we're taking a TM Bad Thing from
	 * the kernel.
