VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a declaration of a static inline function `rpl_exit` and two function prototypes `ipv6_rpl_srh_size` and `ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress`. No actual implementation of these functions is provided, which limits the analysis of potential vulnerabilities. However, based on the given declarations, no obvious security issues can be identified.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static inline void rpl_exit(void) {}
#endif

size_t ipv6_rpl_srh_size(unsigned char n, unsigned char cmpri,
			 unsigned char cmpre);

void ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress(struct ipv6_rpl_sr_hdr *outhdr,
