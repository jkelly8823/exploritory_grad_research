VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code checks for the existence of `__GLIBC_PREREQ` but includes `<unistd.h>` and `<sys/syscall.h>` regardless, potentially resulting in undefined behavior if the system does not support `__GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)`.
EXPLANATION:
The `__GLIBC_PREREQ` macro is used to check if the system supports a specific version of the GNU C Library. However, the conditional statement's `|| !__GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)` expression may be evaluated even if `__GLIBC_PREREQ` is not defined. This could happen if the preprocessor decides to evaluate the expression from left to right and encounters an undefined `__GLIBC_PREREQ`. Furthermore, the code does not check the return value of `__GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)`, which could be 0 (false) on platforms that do not support the required glibc version.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this potential issue, use the `#ifdef` directive instead, like this:
```c
#ifdef __GLIBC_PREREQ
#if __GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)
/* This code block will only be executed if __GLIBC_PREREQ is defined and
   the system supports glibc version 2.30 or later */
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#else
/* Added Error Handling for when the system doesn't support the glibc version */
#error "Unsupported glibc version, please use version 2.30 or later."
#endif  // __GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)
#else  // __GLIBC_PREREQ is not defined
#error "__GLIBC_PREREQ undefined, unsupported platform"
#endif  // __GLIBC_PREREQ
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int perf_event_disable(int fd);
int perf_event_reset(int fd);

#if !defined(__GLIBC_PREREQ) || !__GLIBC_PREREQ(2, 30)
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
```
