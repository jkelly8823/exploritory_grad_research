VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure system information read from possibly untrusted sources

EXPLANATION:
The function read_24x7_sys_info() appears to be reading system information into potentially sensitive areas of the system. Without knowing more about the context or implementation of read_24x7_sys_info(), this operation could be insecure. 
Particularly, if the read operation does not properly validate the input or uses insecure protocols to fetch the data, this could be vulnerable to tampering attacks. 
Moreover, since cpus_read_unlock() was just called, multiple CPUs might be accessing this function simultaneously which could result in a race condition if the function is not properly thread-safe.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement proper input validation and sanitization when performing the system information read operation in read_24x7_sys_info(). 
Review the function's implementation for thread safety and proper synchronization.
Consider using a secure protocol when fetching system information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	cpus_read_unlock();

	/* Possibly switch to a new RFI flush type */
	pseries_setup_rfi_flush();

	/* Reinitialise system information for hv-24x7 */
	read_24x7_sys_info();
