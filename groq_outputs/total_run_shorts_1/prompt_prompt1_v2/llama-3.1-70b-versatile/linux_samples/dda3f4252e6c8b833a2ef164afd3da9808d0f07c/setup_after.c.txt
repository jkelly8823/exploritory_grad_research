VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential vulnerability due to a double-checked locking pattern is present in the code. This pattern can be problematic because it often leads to subtle bugs that may cause security or stability issues.

EXPLANATION:
The issue is with the usage of `security_ftr_enabled` function to check the feature enablement state in different conditions (`setup_entry_flush` and `setup_uaccess_flush`). The checks are read twice and acted upon without ensuring that the state hasn't changed in between. This can lead to inconsistent states and potentially pose a threat. Moreover, since `security_ftr_enabled` function appears to be checking security features, the inconsistency in enabling certain mitigation techniques could have security implications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a lock to ensure that the checks and their corresponding setups are performed atomically. This can be achieved by instantiating a lock before the checks and then setting up the required security mitigations while still holding the lock. This can prevent any other concurrently running threads from changing the state of the security features while the setups are being performed.
- Refactor the code to eliminate the need for double-checked locking if it's not required for performance reasons.
- Consider leveraging compiler barriers to avoid any optimizations that may compromise the expected behavior of this double-checked locking pattern.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
    security_ftr_clear(SEC_FTR_BNDS_CHK_SPEC_BAR);
}

void pseries_setup_security_mitigations(void)
{
    struct h_cpu_char_result result;
    enum l1d_flush_type types;
    bool enable;

    setup_rfi_flush(types, enable);
    setup_count_cache_flush();

    enable = security_ftr_enabled(SEC_FTR_FAVOUR_SECURITY) &&
             security_ftr_enabled(SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_ENTRY);
    setup_entry_flush(enable);

    enable = security_ftr_enabled(SEC_FTR_FAVOUR_SECURITY) &&
             security_ftr_enabled(SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_UACCESS);
    setup_uaccess_flush(enable);

    setup_stf_barrier();
}

#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_IOV
enum rtas_iov_fw_value_map {

    fwnmi_init();

    pseries_setup_security_mitigations();
    pseries_lpar_read_hblkrm_characteristics();
