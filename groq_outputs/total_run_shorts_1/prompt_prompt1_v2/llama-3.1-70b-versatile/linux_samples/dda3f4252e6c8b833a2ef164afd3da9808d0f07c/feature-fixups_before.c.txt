VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No significant vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a function definition and a couple of function calls. It does not handle any user input or perform any operations that can lead to common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow or SQL injection. Since we do not have information about the called functions (`do_stf_exit_barrier_fixups` and `do_rfi_flush_fixups`), we cannot evaluate their security. However, based on the given code, no vulnerability is found.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code seems clean, but it is recommended to examine the called functions (`do_stf_exit_barrier_fixups` and `do_rfi_flush_fixups`) for potential vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
do_stf_exit_barrier_fixups(types);
}

void do_rfi_flush_fixups(enum l1d_flush_type types)
{
	unsigned int instrs[3], *dest;
	long *start, *end;
```
