VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be written in Device Tree Source (DTS) format, a human-readable ASCII data base description for device trees.

No obvious vulnerabilities were detected, and no critical information is being exposed or manipulated insecurely.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	scfg: scfg@1570000 {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-scfg", "syscon";
		reg = <0x0 0x1570000 0x0 0x10000>;
	};

'clockgen: clocking@1ee1000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
