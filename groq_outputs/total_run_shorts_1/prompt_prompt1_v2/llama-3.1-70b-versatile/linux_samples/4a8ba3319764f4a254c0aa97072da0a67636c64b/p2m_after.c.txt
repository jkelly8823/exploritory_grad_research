VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential double-free vulnerability is present.

EXPLANATION:
In the `free_p2m_page` function, the code checks if `slab_is_available()` before deciding whether to call `free_bootmem` or `free_page`. However, in some cases, it is possible that `free_bootmem` and `free_page` both deallocate memory. This might happen if `slab_is_available()` is `false` but later is `true` when `free_page` is called.

But that's not what caught my attention, it is the missing lock acquire for p2m_update_lock that could lead to double frees (although this requires p2m_update_lock to be already acquired).

After careful analysis of `alloc_p2m_pmd`, I found another potential vulnerability, the `spin_unlock_irqrestore` is called but, I couldn't see a `spin_lock_irqsave` being called before this. This is because there's no clear view on some function calls, main issue here though, is potential unlocking of an already unlocked lock which in some contexts can lead to undefined behavior.

Also, there's a missing allocation for pte_newpg array elements, in case ptechk does not equal pte_pg.

Additionally, we could have a scenario in alloc_p2m_pmd() where pmdp is used before it has been checked for NULL. There is no NULL check of pmdp.

Lastly, we don't have code for slabs allocation/free.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Ensure that `spin_lock_irqsave` and `spin_unlock_irqrestore` calls are used in pairs.

Provide for all these NULL checks in order to prevent against double-free vulnerabilities.

If pmd level is missing allocate a new one and then check against missing_pte or identity_pte with a ptepg NULL check.

Ensure all allocations for pte_newpg elements are properly handled.

You may need to introduce slab allocation checks in `free_p2m_page` function in certain circumstances.
