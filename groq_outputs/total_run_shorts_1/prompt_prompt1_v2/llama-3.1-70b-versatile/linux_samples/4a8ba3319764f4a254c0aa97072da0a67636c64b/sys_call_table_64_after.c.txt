VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a system call table implementation in a Linux kernel-like environment. It defines an array of function pointers `sys_call_table` that is used to dispatch system calls. The code snippet is incomplete, and there is not enough information to determine if any vulnerability is present. However, based on the provided lines, there is no apparent issue that suggests a vulnerability. The use of `____cacheline_aligned` suggests that the code is intended to optimize performance by aligning the array to a cache line boundary, but this does not introduce any vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern void sys_ni_syscall(void);

const sys_call_ptr_t sys_call_table[] ____cacheline_aligned = {
	/*
	 * Smells like a compiler bug -- it doesn't work
	 * when the & below is removed.
	 */
```
