VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be a Device Tree Source file (DTS) that describes the hardware components and configuration of a system. The code defines regulators, GPIOs, and clocks for USB OTG and USB Host interfaces. However, no known security vulnerabilities were detected in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary since none were found.
