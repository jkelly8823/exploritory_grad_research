VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a series of macros defining hexadecimal values and bit masks for OMAP5 and DRA7 chips. The code is purely declarative and does not contain any executable statements that could potentially introduce a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
#define OMAP5XXX_CONTROL_STATUS                0x134
#define OMAP5_DEVICETYPE_MASK          (0x7 << 6)

/* DRA7XX CONTROL CORE BOOTSTRAP */
#define DRA7_CTRL_CORE_BOOTSTRAP	0x6c4
#define DRA7_SPEEDSELECT_MASK		(0x3 << 8)

/*
 * REVISIT: This list of registers is not comprehensive - there are more
