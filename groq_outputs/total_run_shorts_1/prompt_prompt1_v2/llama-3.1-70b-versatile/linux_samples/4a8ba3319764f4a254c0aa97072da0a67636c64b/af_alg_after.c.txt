VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a completion handler for an asynchronous operation. It checks if an error occurred and if so, assigns it to the completion structure and signals its completion. The error is also checked against -EINPROGRESS, in which case the function returns without further action. The EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro is used to make the af_alg_complete function available as a kernel symbol for GPL-licensed modules. 
There is no evidence of any obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- None. The code appears to be safe as it is, with proper error handling and validation. It is recommended, however, to always run additional analysis and testing across the full codebase to confirm this assessment.
ORIGINAL CODE: 
```
{
	struct af_alg_completion *completion = req->data;

	if (err == -EINPROGRESS)
		return;

	completion->err = err;
	complete(&completion->completion);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(af_alg_complete);
```
