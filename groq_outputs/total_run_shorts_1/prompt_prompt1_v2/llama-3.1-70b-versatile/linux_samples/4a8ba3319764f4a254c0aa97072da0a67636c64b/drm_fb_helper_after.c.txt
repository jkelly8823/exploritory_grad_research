VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double DRM modeset lock acquisition vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes two calls to `__drm_modeset_lock_all` with the same argument parameters. The second call to acquire the lock is not checked for whether the lock is already held by the current thread. This can lead to a situation where the lock is double-locked, causing a deadlock.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should verify whether the lock is already held before attempting to acquire it a second time. The lock can be checked using a global or per-thread variable that tracks the lock's current state. Alternatively, the second call to `__drm_modeset_lock_all` can be removed to prevent unnecessary locking.

Additionally, if the lock is intended to be reentrant, the implementation of `__drm_modeset_lock_all` should be thread-aware to prevent deadlocks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	int i, j, rc = 0;
	int start;

	if (__drm_modeset_lock_all(dev, !!oops_in_progress)) {
		return -EBUSY;
	}
	if (!drm_fb_helper_is_bound(fb_helper)) {
		drm_modeset_unlock_all(dev);
		return -EBUSY;
	}
	int ret = 0;
	int i;

	if (__drm_modeset_lock_all(dev, !!oops_in_progress)) {
		return -EBUSY;
	}
	if (!drm_fb_helper_is_bound(fb_helper)) {
		drm_modeset_unlock_all(dev);
		return -EBUSY;
	}
