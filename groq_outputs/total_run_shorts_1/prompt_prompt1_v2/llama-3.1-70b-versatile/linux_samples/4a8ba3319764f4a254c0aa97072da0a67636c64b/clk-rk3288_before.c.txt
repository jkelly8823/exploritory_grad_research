VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: There are no identified vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to define a table of CPU clock rates for the Rockchip RK3288 processor and a struct to store CPU clock register data. The code uses a series of macros (e.g. RK3288_CPUCLK_RATE and RK3288_CLKSEL_CON) to fill in the table and struct. There are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this code, such as user input not being validated or operations that could lead to buffer overflows. The code seems to be a straightforward definition of constants and a struct, and does not perform any dynamic operations that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were identified.
