VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a device driver or low-level system code that checks for device availability and configuration. The code snippet uses pointer checks to prevent potential null pointer dereferences, which is a good practice. It also returns error codes if certain conditions are not met, which is appropriate for handling errors.

There are no obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or unchecked user input. The code snippet seems to follow best practices for error handling and pointer safety.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is always a good practice to review the entire codebase to ensure that there are no other potential vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (!np)
	return -ENODEV;

if (!of_device_is_available(np))
	return -ENODEV;

cci_config = of_match_node(arm_cci_matches, np)->data;
if (!cci_config)
	return -ENODEV;
```
