VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a segment from a larger function, likely in a C-based system programming context, given the use of `pr_err` which is a logging function in Linux kernel. It appears to be a conditional block handling TSC calibration failure. However, upon examination, no security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or arbitrary code execution were identified in this limited code snippet. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
	goto success;
	}
}
pr_err("Fast TSC calibration failed\n");
return 0;

success:
