VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a set of PCI device definitions. There is no user input, sensitive data handling, or potential for memory corruption. Each PCI device is defined with a fixed vendor and device ID, and they are all mapped to the same board_ahci handler.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are needed in this case. However, it's worth noting that defining two identical PCI devices with the same vendor and device ID (0x9d05 and 0x9d07 are not identical but 0xa103 is repeated) could potentially cause issues in certain situations.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0x9d05), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-LP RAID */
    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0x9d07), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-LP RAID */
    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa103), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H AHCI */
    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa103), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H RAID */
    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa105), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H RAID */
    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa107), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H RAID */
    { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa10f), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H RAID */
