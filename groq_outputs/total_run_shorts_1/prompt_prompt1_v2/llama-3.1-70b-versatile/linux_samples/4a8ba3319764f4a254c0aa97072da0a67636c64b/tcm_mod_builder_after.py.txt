VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection and format string attacks due to the use of string concatenation and variable interpolation in format strings. 

EXPLANATION:
In several instances, the code concatenates strings using the `+` operator and then uses the resulting string as a format string or assigns it to a variable. This can lead to code injection attacks if an attacker can control the values of `fabric_mod_name` or `fabric_mod_port`. For example, if `fabric_mod_name` contains a format specifier like `%s` or `%n`, an attacker could inject malicious code or crash the program. Similarly, if `fabric_mod_port` is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious data.

Additionally, some function declarations and definitions have missing bounds checks or error handling. This could lead to security issues like buffer overflows or data corruption if the functions are called with invalid or malicious input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use secure formatting functions instead of string concatenation and variable interpolation. 
2. Sanitize user-provided input, like `fabric_mod_name` and `fabric_mod_port`, to prevent code injection attacks.
3. Add bounds checks and error handling to all function declarations and definitions to prevent buffer overflows and data corruption.
