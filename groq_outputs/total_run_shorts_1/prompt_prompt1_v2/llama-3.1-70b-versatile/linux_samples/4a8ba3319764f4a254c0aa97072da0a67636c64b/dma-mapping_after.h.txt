VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identifiable vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be part of a larger system for managing dma (Direct Memory Access) operations. It defines two functions, `arch_setup_dma_ops` and `is_device_dma_coherent`. Upon reviewing this code, no obvious vulnerabilities are present. The code uses proper checks before making assignments, and no apparent injection or manipulation attacks could be identified. Given the nature of the code snippet, potential vulnerabilities may exist elsewhere in the larger system, but in this specific code snippet, no vulnerabilities could be found.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:

    dev->archdata.dma_ops = ops;
}

static inline void arch_setup_dma_ops(struct device *dev, u64 dma_base, u64 size,
				      struct iommu_ops *iommu, bool coherent)
{
	dev->archdata.dma_coherent = coherent;
	if (coherent)
		set_dma_ops(dev, &coherent_swiotlb_dma_ops);
}
#define arch_setup_dma_ops	arch_setup_dma_ops

/* do not use this function in a driver */
static inline bool is_device_dma_coherent(struct device *dev)
