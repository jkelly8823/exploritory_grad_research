VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit any vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines two constants using the `#define` preprocessor directive. It defines `OMAP5XXX_CONTROL_STATUS` as a hexadecimal value and `OMAP5_DEVICETYPE_MASK` as a bitwise operation on a hexadecimal value. This code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.

The code snippet also includes a comment indicating that the list of registers is not comprehensive. However, this comment does not indicate a security vulnerability, but rather an area for future improvement.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
#define OMAP5XXX_CONTROL_STATUS                0x134
#define OMAP5_DEVICETYPE_MASK          (0x7 << 6)

/*
 * REVISIT: This list of registers is not comprehensive - there are more
 * that should be added.
