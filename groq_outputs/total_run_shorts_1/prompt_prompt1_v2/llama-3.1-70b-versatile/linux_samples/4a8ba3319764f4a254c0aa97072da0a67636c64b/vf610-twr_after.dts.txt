VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a device tree configuration for an Ethernet interface. It defines two Ethernet FEC (Fast Ethernet Controller) devices and their corresponding PHY (Physical Layer) handles. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, command injection, or misuse of sensitive functions.

The code only defines the device tree configuration and does not contain any executable code that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. The syntax and structure of the code are correct and follow standard practices.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
&fec0 {
	phy-mode = "rmii";
	phy-handle = <&ethphy0>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_fec0>;
	status = "okay";

	mdio {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		ethphy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};

		ethphy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
};

&fec1 {
	phy-mode = "rmii";
	phy-handle = <&ethphy1>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
