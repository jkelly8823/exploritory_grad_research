VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a portion of an entry point for secondary CPU to jump from ROM code on OMAP5 and OMAP4 specific systems. It includes definitions for physical addresses and procedures for initializing the secondary CPU. 

Our analysis did not reveal any potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, data validation issues, or insecure API usage that would cause the code to be vulnerable to attacks. The provided code appears to be well-structured and follows secure coding practices.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
(Original code was too long - this analysis is focused on the first part)
```c
/* Physical address needed since MMU not enabled yet on secondary core */

/*
 * Same as omap5_secondary_startup except we call into the ROM to
 * enable HYP mode first.  This is called instead of
 * omap5_secondary_startup if the primary CPU was put into HYP mode by
