VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is checking if the input node pointer `np` and the matched configuration `cci_config` are valid. If either of these conditions fails, it immediately returns an error code, preventing further execution. There are no signs of buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, injection vulnerabilities, or other security issues. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for this code snippet, as no vulnerability was detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (!np)
		return -ENODEV;

cci_config = of_match_node(arm_cci_matches, np)->data;
if (!cci_config)
		return -ENODEV;
```
