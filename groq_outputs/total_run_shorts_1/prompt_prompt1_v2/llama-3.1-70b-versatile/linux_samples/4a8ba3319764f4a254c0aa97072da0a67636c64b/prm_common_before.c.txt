VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16-18, 25-26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable due to Null pointer dereferences and invalid memory accesses.

EXPLANATION:
In this code segment, two potential vulnerabilities have been found. 

Firstly, on Line 16, we have a null pointer dereference. After setting `prcm_irq_setup->priority_mask` to NULL on Line 6, the function still uses `prcm_irq_setup->irq` on Lines 16 without checking if `prcm_irq_setup` itself is NULL before dereferencing it. This could lead to segmentation faults and an abnormal termination of the program. 

Secondly, Lines 25 and 26 contain possibly invalid memory accesses if `irq_setup` is NULL. While this specific vulnerability may not always be triggered since `irq_setup` will likely be set before this function is called, checks should be put in place to handle potential null values to avoid unexpected application crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, the following modifications could be made:
- Before accessing any member variables of `prcm_irq_setup` after setting its member `priority_mask` to NULL, ensure that `prcm_irq_setup` itself is not NULL. 
- Add checks before using `irq_setup` to prevent null pointer dereferences.

To specifically correct the code inside `omap_prcm_irq_cleanup(void)`, you can check to see if the value at `prcm_irq_setup` has been set to NULL after creating the local variable `i` i.e. before starting the second `if` condition, just check to see if `prcm_irq_setup` is NULL. 

```c
if(prcm_irq_setup != NULL){
    irq_set_chained_handler(prcm_irq_setup->irq, NULL);
}
```
Similar checks should be applied before accessing `irq_setup->irq` to avoid potential null pointer dereferences.

Additionally, consider putting checks to ensure you do not access memory you are not allocated, to improve the safety and security of your application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
*/
void omap_prcm_irq_cleanup(void)
{
	int i;

	if (!prcm_irq_setup) {
		pr_err("PRCM: IRQ handler not initialized; cannot cleanup\n");
	kfree(prcm_irq_setup->priority_mask);
	prcm_irq_setup->priority_mask = NULL;

	irq_set_chained_handler(prcm_irq_setup->irq, NULL);

	if (prcm_irq_setup->base_irq > 0)
		irq_free_descs(prcm_irq_setup->base_irq,
			prcm_irq_setup->nr_regs * 32);
	int offset, i;
	struct irq_chip_generic *gc;
	struct irq_chip_type *ct;

	if (!irq_setup)
		return -EINVAL;

				1 << (offset & 0x1f);
	}

	irq_set_chained_handler(irq_setup->irq, omap_prcm_irq_handler);

	irq_setup->base_irq = irq_alloc_descs(-1, 0, irq_setup->nr_regs * 32,
		0);
