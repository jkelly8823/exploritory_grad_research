VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be initializing a clock event device (ced) and setting its features, rating, CPU mask, and function pointers for various operations. The code uses binary bit operations for setting the features and does not involve any user input, dynamic memory allocation, or potential data corruption. There are no apparent issues with the control flow, data integrity, or potential buffer overflows in the provided snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities have been detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
ced->features = CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_PERIODIC;
ced->features |= CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_ONESHOT;
ced->rating = 200;
ced->cpumask = cpu_possible_mask;
ced->set_next_event = sh_tmu_clock_event_next;
ced->set_mode = sh_tmu_clock_event_mode;
ced->suspend = sh_tmu_clock_event_suspend;
ced->resume = sh_tmu_clock_event_resume;
