VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to missing error handling in kobject_add operation.

EXPLANATION:
The blk_mq_unregister_hctx function iterates over each CPU context of a hardware context and attempts to add a kobject to the hardware context's kobject. If kobject_add fails (i.e., ret is nonzero), the function breaks out of the loop and returns the error code. However, the kobjects that were successfully added earlier in the loop are not released. As a result, if kobject_add fails, this will cause a resource leak since the previously added kobjects are left unregistered. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should release the successfully added kobjects in the event of an error. This can be achieved by registering a cleanup operation to remove the kobjects if an error occurs during the loop.

```c
static void blk_mq_unregister_hctx(struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *hctx)
{
	int ret;
	hctx_for_each_ctx(hctx, ctx, i) {
		ret = kobject_add(&ctx->kobj, &hctx->kobj, "cpu%u", ctx->cpu);
		if (ret)
			break;
	}
	// Add error handling code to release kobjects in event of error
	if (ret) {
		while (i-- > 0) {
			hctx_for_each_ctx(hctx, ctx, i) {
				kobject_del(&ctx->kobj);
			}
		}
	}
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static void blk_mq_sysfs_release(struct kobject *kobj)
{
}

struct blk_mq_ctx_sysfs_entry {
	struct attribute attr;
static struct kobj_type blk_mq_ctx_ktype = {
	.sysfs_ops	= &blk_mq_sysfs_ops,
	.default_attrs	= default_ctx_attrs,
	.release	= blk_mq_sysfs_release,
};

static struct kobj_type blk_mq_hw_ktype = {
	.sysfs_ops	= &blk_mq_hw_sysfs_ops,
	.default_attrs	= default_hw_ctx_attrs,
	.release	= blk_mq_sysfs_release,
};

static void blk_mq_unregister_hctx(struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *hctx)
{
		return ret;

	hctx_for_each_ctx(hctx, ctx, i) {
		ret = kobject_add(&ctx->kobj, &hctx->kobj, "cpu%u", ctx->cpu);
		if (ret)
			break;
	}
