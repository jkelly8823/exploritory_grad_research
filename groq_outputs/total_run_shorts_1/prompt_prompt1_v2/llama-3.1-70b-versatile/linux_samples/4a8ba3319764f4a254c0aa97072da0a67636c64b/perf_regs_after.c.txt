VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential Information Disclosure due to usage of uninitialized memory in an NMI context.

EXPLANATION:
The function `perf_get_regs_user` reads the register values from the `task_pt_regs(current)` and copies them to `regs_user_copy` and then assigns `regs_user_copy` to `regs_user->regs`. However, if the function is interrupted by an NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) before the register values are saved, the values of some registers may not be saved and `regs_user_copy` will contain garbage values. The function attempts to determine whether an NMI has interrupted the task_pt_regs setup, but this check is not sufficient to guarantee that the register values are valid.

The assignment of `regs_user->regs` from `regs_user_copy` after reading the register values can lead to potential information disclosure. The source `regs_user_copy` may contain register values that are not valid or may have been modified during the execution of the NMI handler.

Additionally, there is no validation or sanitization of the data read from the registers, which can also lead to potential information disclosure or incorrect assumptions about the register values.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The function should not read or assign register values in an NMI context.
2. If the function must read or assign register values, it should validate and sanitize the data read from the registers.
3. Consider using a more robust method of determining whether an NMI has interrupted the task_pt_regs setup.
