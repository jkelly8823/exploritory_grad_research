VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The provided code snippet does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is a documentation excerpt describing two kernel parameters, "route/max_size" and "neigh/default/gc_thresh1". It contains no executable code, no input validation or handling, and no indications of potential security vulnerabilities. Given its context as documentation comments, this snippet is not likely to introduce vulnerabilities into a larger codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are necessary, as this code snippet does not appear to pose a security risk.

ORIGINAL CODE:
route/max_size - INTEGER
	Maximum number of routes allowed in the kernel.  Increase
	this when using large numbers of interfaces and/or routes.

neigh/default/gc_thresh1 - INTEGER
	Minimum number of entries to keep.  Garbage collector will not
	purge entries if there are fewer than this number.
