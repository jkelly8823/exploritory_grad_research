VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a device tree configuration for a series of OMAP DWC3 (Device Controller) instances. It sets properties such as maximum speed and quirks for the devices. After reviewing the code, I did not find any obvious security vulnerabilities. The code does not contain any user input, sensitive data handling, or potentially executable logic that could lead to a security vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the lack of a vulnerability, no recommended fixes are applicable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
				tx-fifo-resize;
				maximum-speed = "super-speed";
				dr_mode = "otg";
				snps,dis_u3_susphy_quirk;
				snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk;
			};
		};

		omap_dwc3_2: omap_dwc3_2@488c0000 {
				tx-fifo-resize;
				maximum-speed = "high-speed";
				dr_mode = "otg";
				snps,dis_u3_susphy_quirk;
				snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk;
			};
		};

		/* IRQ for DWC3_3 and DWC3_4 need IRQ crossbar */
				tx-fifo-resize;
				maximum-speed = "high-speed";
				dr_mode = "otg";
				snps,dis_u3_susphy_quirk;
				snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk;
			};
		};
