VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure function call that does not validate its arguments.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calls the function `hqd_is_occupies` without validating the input arguments. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds array access if `pipe_id` or `queue_id` is not validated and contains malicious data. However, to make a more informed assessment, more context about the function's expected input values and how the variables `mm->dev->kgd`, `queue_address`, `pipe_id`, and `queue_id` are initialized would be necessary.

Additionally, the function `hqd_is_occupies` is likely to be a memory-mapped access, and without bounds checking or a definition of what these values represent, it is possible that an attacker could use an erroneous value of `pipe_id` or `queue_id` to dereference memory out of its allocated bounds.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, validate `pipe_id` and `queue_id` to ensure they fall within the expected range of values. Ensure that `queue_address` is a valid pointer and that `mm->dev->kgd` is not null. Additionally, review the implementation of the function `hqd_is_occupies` to ensure it also includes proper bounds checking.

ORIGINAL CODE:
uint32_t queue_id)
{

	return kfd2kgd->hqd_is_occupies(mm->dev->kgd, queue_address,
					pipe_id, queue_id);
