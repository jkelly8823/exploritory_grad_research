VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet does not contain a clear vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a small section of assembly code and macro definitions. Upon analysis, there is no clear vulnerability present. The code defines constants and entry points for secondary CPU startup routines, but there are no signs of insecure memory access, buffer overflows, or exploitable control flow. The jump statements are likely targetting labeled branches, and without seeing the full assembly code, it is assumed that these labels are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
/* Physical address needed since MMU not enabled yet on secondary core */
#define AUX_CORE_BOOT0_PA			0x48281800

/*
 * OMAP5 specific entry point for secondary CPU to jump from ROM

/*
 * OMAP4 specific entry point for secondary CPU to jump from ROM
 * code.  This routine also provides a holding flag into which
 * secondary core is held until we're ready for it to initialise.
