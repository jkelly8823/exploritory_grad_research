ORIGINAL CODE:
route/max_size - INTEGER
	Maximum number of routes allowed in the kernel.  Increase
	this when using large numbers of interfaces and/or routes.
	From linux kernel 3.6 onwards, this is deprecated for ipv4
	as route cache is no longer used.

neigh/default/gc_thresh1 - INTEGER
	Minimum number of entries to keep.  Garbage collector will not
	purge entries if there are fewer than this number.
