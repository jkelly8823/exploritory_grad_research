VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Improper use of ELSE statement, potentially leading to incorrect register usage.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is conditional code that has been merged. The improper use of ELSE statement refers to the fact that there is no corresponding IF statement. This could potentially cause issues in certain scenarios. However, the real issue here is that the macro definition for REG_NOSUPPORT is incomplete as it does not include all the necessary registers for a 64-bit system. 

The ELSE statement is misplaced from the macro definition. 

The return statement and else are used together without the corresponding IF statement to check the condition.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a corresponding IF statement to match the ELSE statement and complete the definition of REG_NOSUPPORT.

ORIGINAL CODE:
{
	return PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_ABI_32;
}
#else /* CONFIG_X86_64 */
#define REG_NOSUPPORT ((1ULL << PERF_REG_X86_DS) | \
		       (1ULL << PERF_REG_X86_ES) | \
		       (1ULL << PERF_REG_X86_FS) | \
	else
		return PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_ABI_64;
}
#endif /* CONFIG_X86_32 */
