VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of inline assembly that utilizes the LSL instruction to load the per-CPU data. This instruction is not inherently vulnerable and appears to be used properly. The use of "asm volatile" ensures that the compiler will not optimize or re-order this instruction. There is no indication of any buffer overflows, integer overflow, or other potential vulnerabilities in this specific snippet. Given the snippet does not receive input or process data, the risks of typical programming errors such as SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, etc., do not apply here.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No changes or recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
/*
 * Load per CPU data from GDT.  LSL is faster than RDTSCP and
 * works on all CPUs.  This is volatile so that it orders
 * correctly wrt barrier() and to keep gcc from cleverly
 * hoisting it out of the calling function.
 */
asm volatile ("lsl %1,%0" : "=r" (p) : "r" (__PER_CPU_SEG));

return p;
