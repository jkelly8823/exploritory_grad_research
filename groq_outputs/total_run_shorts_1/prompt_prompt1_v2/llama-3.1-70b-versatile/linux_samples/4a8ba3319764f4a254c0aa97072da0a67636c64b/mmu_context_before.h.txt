VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a function definition for memory unmapping in the Linux kernel, specifically for x86 architecture. The function calls another function, `mpx_notify_unmap`, passing the provided parameters. There are no visible vulnerabilities in this segment. The function parameters seem to be properly validated and used correctly. The function does not seem to perform any operations that could potentially lead to a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
static inline void arch_unmap(struct mm_struct *mm, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
			      unsigned long start, unsigned long end)
{
	mpx_notify_unmap(mm, vma, start, end);
}
