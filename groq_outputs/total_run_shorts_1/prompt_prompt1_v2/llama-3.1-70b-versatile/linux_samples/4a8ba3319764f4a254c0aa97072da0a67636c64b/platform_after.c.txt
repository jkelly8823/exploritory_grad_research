VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to missing error handling

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is missing proper error handling in the `dw_dma_probe` call. If `dw_dma_probe` fails, the function will attempt to release resources such as disabling power management and unpreparing the clock. However, the resource `chip->clk` is also disabled and unprepared in a separate block of code, but its counterpart `clk_prepare_enable` is not shown. If a failure occurs in `dw_dma_probe`, this counterpart may not have been executed, potentially causing the clock to remain unprepared. This could cause resource leaks.

Additionally, `dw_dma_remove` may potentially fail and return an error, but it is not handled. This could also cause resources to not be cleaned up properly.

Lastly, `of_dma_controller_free` may potentially return an error, but it is not checked and no error handling is performed. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) Verify that `clk_prepare_enable` is called and is checked before attempting to use `chip->clk` by adding the necessary error handling to ensure this resource is correctly prepared and later cleaned up.
2) Check the return value of `dw_dma_remove` and perform proper error handling to prevent resource leaks.
3) Check the return value of `of_dma_controller_free` and perform proper error handling.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
if (err)
	return err;

pm_runtime_enable(&pdev->dev);

err = dw_dma_probe(chip, pdata);
if (err)
	goto err_dw_dma_probe;

return 0;

err_dw_dma_probe:
pm_runtime_disable(&pdev->dev);
clk_disable_unprepare(chip->clk);
return err;
}

of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node);

dw_dma_remove(chip);
pm_runtime_disable(&pdev->dev);
clk_disable_unprepare(chip->clk);

return 0;
} 
```
