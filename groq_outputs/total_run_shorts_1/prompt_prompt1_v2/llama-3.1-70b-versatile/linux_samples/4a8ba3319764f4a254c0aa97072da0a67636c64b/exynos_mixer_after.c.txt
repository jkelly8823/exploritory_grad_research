VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a double unlock of a mutex.

EXPLANATION:
In the `mixer_wait_for_vblank` function, the mutex `mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex` is locked and then immediately unlocked when the `mixer_ctx->powered` condition is not met. However, the mutex is locked again before the initial unlock, which leads to an additional call to `mutex_unlock` after the initial unlock. This double unlock can cause undefined behavior and potentially crash the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, remove the second call to `mutex_unlock` when `mixer_ctx->powered` is not set. The corrected code should look like this:

```c
mutex_lock(&mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex);
if (!mixer_ctx->powered) {
    mutex_unlock(&mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex);
    // Add a return statement here to avoid accessing mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex again
    return;
}
```
Additionally, it is recommended to handle the use-after-free condition that could potentially occur if `mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex` is accessed after the `return` statement.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static void mixer_wait_for_vblank(struct exynos_drm_manager *mgr)
{
    struct mixer_context *mixer_ctx = mgr_to_mixer(mgr);
    int err;

    mutex_lock(&mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex);
    if (!mixer_ctx->powered) {
        mutex_unlock(&mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex);
    }
    mutex_unlock(&mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex);

    err = drm_vblank_get(mgr->crtc->dev, mixer_ctx->pipe);
    if (err < 0) {
        DRM_DEBUG_KMS("failed to acquire vblank counter\n");
        return;
    }

    atomic_set(&mixer_ctx->wait_vsync_event, 1);

    /*
    return ret;
}

return 0;
}

static void mixer_unbind(struct device *dev, struct device *master, void *data)
    struct mixer_context *ctx = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

    mixer_mgr_remove(&ctx->manager);
}

    .bind    = mixer_bind,
