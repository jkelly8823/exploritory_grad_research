VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No security vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a system's DMA (Direct Memory Access) operations handling. It defines functions for setting arch-specific DMA coherent operations and checking whether a device is DMA coherent. However, no potential security vulnerabilities or errors were identified in this code snippet.

The use of inline functions and static definitions suggests that these functions are only intended for local use within the same compilation unit, which reduces the potential attack surface. Additionally, the functions do not directly access sensitive resources or execute potentially malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No security-related recommendations can be provided for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
dev->archdata.dma_ops = ops;
}

static inline int set_arch_dma_coherent_ops(struct device *dev)
{
dev->archdata.dma_coherent = true;
set_dma_ops(dev, &coherent_swiotlb_dma_ops);
return 0;
}
#define set_arch_dma_coherent_ops set_arch_dma_coherent_ops

/* do not use this function in a driver */
static inline bool is_device_dma_coherent(struct device *dev)
```
