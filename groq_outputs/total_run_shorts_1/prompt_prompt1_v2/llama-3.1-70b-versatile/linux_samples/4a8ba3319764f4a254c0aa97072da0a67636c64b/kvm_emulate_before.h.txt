VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of two functions: `vcpu_reset_hcr` and `vcpu_pc`. The `vcpu_reset_hcr` function resets the HCR (Hypervisor Configuration Register) for a virtual CPU with a specific flag, while the `vcpu_pc` function returns a pointer to the program counter for a given virtual CPU. After analyzing the code, I did not find any apparent vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows, memory leaks, or other common issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static inline void vcpu_reset_hcr(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
	vcpu->arch.hcr_el2 = HCR_GUEST_FLAGS;
}

static inline unsigned long *vcpu_pc(const struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
```
