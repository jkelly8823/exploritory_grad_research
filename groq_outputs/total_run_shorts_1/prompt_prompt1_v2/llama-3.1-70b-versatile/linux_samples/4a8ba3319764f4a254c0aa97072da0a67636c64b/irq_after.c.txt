VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that prints some statistics related to machine check polls and hypervisor callback interrupts. After analyzing the code, I did not find any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use of deprecated functions, or potential for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are required, as no vulnerabilities were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
seq_puts(p, "  Machine check polls\n");
#endif
#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_HYPERV) || defined(CONFIG_XEN)
	seq_printf(p, "%*s: ", prec, "HYP");
	for_each_online_cpu(j)
		seq_printf(p, "%10u ", irq_stats(j)->irq_hv_callback_count);
	seq_puts(p, "  Hypervisor callback interrupts\n");
#endif
```
Note: Please provide more context or the full code if you suspect an issue but couldn't spot it. Also, be aware that certain vulnerabilities can only be detected by analyzing the code in its entirety or with more context.
