VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unauthorized Access Due to Insufficient License Enforcement
EXPLANATION:
The MODULE_LICENSE macro exports a licensable module with the strings "GPL and additional rights". The phrase "additional rights" could potentially introduce ambiguity and unauthorized access. This is particularly worrying when it involves kernel modules that can have elevated access to sensitive information and execution environments. A well-defined license can help the kernel to enforce specific policies on who should have elevated access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate the potential vulnerabilities associated with a license marked as "GPL and additional rights," consider replacing it with a clear-specific license. In the Linux kernel, use a clear definition from the set of licenses known to work with the kernel, such as 'GPL', 'GPL v2', 'GPL and additional rights', 'Dual BSD/GPL', 'Dual MPL/GPL', or 'Proprietary'. An additional step would be to review the licensing requirements to ensure you are not distributing propietary content.
