VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No discernible vulnerability found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a kernel module initialization routine. It checks if dynamic memory allocation was successful and handles the error case by returning an appropriate error code. There is no obvious indication of a security vulnerability within this specific snippet.

However, it is worth noting that a potential vulnerability may exist if the error handling path is not properly implemented in the omitted parts of the code. For instance, if `out_free_opp` is not defined or doesn't clean up properly, it could potentially lead to a resource leak. Nevertheless, within the context of this snippet, no direct vulnerability is found.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/* OPPs might be populated at runtime, don't check for error here */
of_init_opp_table(cpu_dev);

priv = kzalloc(sizeof(*priv), GFP_KERNEL);
if (!priv) {
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto out_free_opp;
}
```
