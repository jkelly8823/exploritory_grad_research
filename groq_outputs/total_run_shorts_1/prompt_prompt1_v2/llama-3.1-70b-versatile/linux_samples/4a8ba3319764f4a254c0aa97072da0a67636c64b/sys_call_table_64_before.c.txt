VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a partial definition of a system call table. It declares an array of function pointers, `sys_call_table`, and initializes it with a single function pointer, `sys_ni_syscall`. However, there is no indication of a vulnerability within this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as this code does not appear to be vulnerable.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern void sys_ni_syscall(void);

const sys_call_ptr_t sys_call_table[] __cacheline_aligned = {
	/*
	 * Smells like a compiler bug -- it doesn't work
	 * when the & below is removed.
	 */
```
