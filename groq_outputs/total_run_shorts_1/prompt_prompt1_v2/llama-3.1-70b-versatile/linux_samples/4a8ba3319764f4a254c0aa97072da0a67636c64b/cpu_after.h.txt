VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines several 64-bit and 32-bit unsigned integer variables, which appear to be register-based or CPU structure-based. It also includes a declaration for a `cpu_data` structure, allocated on a per-CPU basis using the `DECLARE_PER_CPU` macro.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed for this code, as it does not contain obvious vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
u64		reg_id_aa64pfr0;
u64		reg_id_aa64pfr1;

u32		reg_id_dfr0;
u32		reg_id_isar0;
u32		reg_id_isar1;
u32		reg_id_isar2;
u32		reg_id_isar3;
u32		reg_id_mmfr3;
u32		reg_id_pfr0;
u32		reg_id_pfr1;

u32		reg_mvfr0;
u32		reg_mvfr1;
u32		reg_mvfr2;
};

DECLARE_PER_CPU(struct cpuinfo_arm64, cpu_data);
