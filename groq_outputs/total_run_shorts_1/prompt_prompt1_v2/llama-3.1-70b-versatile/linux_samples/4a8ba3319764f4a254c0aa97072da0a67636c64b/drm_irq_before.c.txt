VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The drm_vblank_enable function is not being called correctly.

EXPLANATION:
However, the function drm_vblank_enable is not even defined in this code, it's being referenced in the function comments above drm_handle_vblank for the correct function to be called in vblank interrupt handlers.

The available functions are drm_vblank_count and drm_vblank_count_and_time. Furthermore, there's drm_send_vblank_event called which passes CRTC to certain functions.

It seems like there is  missing function drm_vblank_enable. Potential incorrect usage on related "vblank interrupt handlers".


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since we do not know the exact requirements of this drm_vblank_enable function we should be very careful in creating alternatives.

*   We could define the drm_vblank_enable function.
*   All functions of interest need to be executed with proper privileges to avoid issues related to kernel vblank.

By taking these precautions you could significantly decrease the risk for kernel issues related to  these missing function calls or handling when your code has been interlaced with other files related to the running applications.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
* vblank events since the system was booted, including lost events due to
* modesetting activity.
*
* Returns:
* The software vblank counter.
