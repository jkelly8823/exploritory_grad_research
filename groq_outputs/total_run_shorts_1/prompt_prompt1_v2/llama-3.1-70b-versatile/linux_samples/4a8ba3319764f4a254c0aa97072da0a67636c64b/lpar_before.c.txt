VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes conditional header includes and a conditional panic function. There are no clear instances of vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or unauthorized access within this snippet. The panic function is used to handle an error condition, and in the context of the provided code, it appears to be a legitimate response to a failure to enable big-endian exceptions.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <asm/trace.h>
#include <asm/firmware.h>
#include <asm/plpar_wrappers.h>
#include <asm/fadump.h>

#include "pseries.h"

		 * out to the user, but at least this will stop us from
		 * continuing on further and creating an even more
		 * difficult to debug situation.
		 */
		if (rc)
			panic("Could not enable big endian exceptions");
	}
#endif
}
```

However, without the complete code and the definitions of `rc`, `panic`, and the `#endif` condition, it is difficult to assess the snippet as a part of a larger system. In any case, there are no immediate, detectable vulnerabilities from this snippet alone.
