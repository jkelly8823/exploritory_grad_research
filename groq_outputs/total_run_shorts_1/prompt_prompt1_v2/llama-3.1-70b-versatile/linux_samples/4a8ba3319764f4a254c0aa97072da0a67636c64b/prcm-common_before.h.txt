VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a declaration of variables and function pointers in C. It does not contain any specific functionality that would indicate the presence of a vulnerability. 

The code seems to be part of a larger system that interacts with the OMAP (Open Media Application Platform) PRCM (Power and Reset Controller) peripheral in an embedded system. Without additional context, such as how these function pointers are being used or how the variables are being manipulated, there is no obvious indication of a vulnerability in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are applicable in this case.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	u8 nr_irqs;
	const struct omap_prcm_irq *irqs;
	int irq;
	void (*read_pending_irqs)(unsigned long *events);
	void (*ocp_barrier)(void);
	void (*save_and_clear_irqen)(u32 *saved_mask);
	void (*restore_irqen)(u32 *saved_mask);
