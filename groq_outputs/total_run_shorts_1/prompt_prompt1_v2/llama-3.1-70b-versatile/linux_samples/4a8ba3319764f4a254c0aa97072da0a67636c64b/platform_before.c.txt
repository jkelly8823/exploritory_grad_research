VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability through unchecked error handling and a double-free of a resource.
 
EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the `dw_dma_remove` function and `clk_disable_unprepare` function are called in two different branches of the code, which can result in a double-free of the `chip->clk` resource if an error occurs before the `dw_dma_remove` function is called. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) as the program may crash or experience unpredictable behavior. 

Another issue is that there are no checks in place to ensure that `chip->clk` is not `NULL` before calling `clk_disable_unprepare` on it. This can cause the program to crash with a segmentation fault.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address the double-free issue, ensure that `dw_dma_remove` and `clk_disable_unprepare` are not called from different error paths. Call `dw_dma_remove` and `clk_disable_unprepare` from the same error handler.

To prevent a potential segmentation fault, add a check to ensure that `chip->clk` is not `NULL` before calling `clk_disable_unprepare`. Here is a sample of how this could be fixed:

```c
if (chip->clk)
    clk_disable_unprepare(chip->clk);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/device.h>
#include <linux/clk.h>
#include <linux/platform_device.h>
#include <linux/dmaengine.h>
#include <linux/dma-mapping.h>
#include <linux/of.h>
if (err)
    return err;

err = dw_dma_probe(chip, pdata);
if (err)
    goto err_dw_dma_probe;

return 0;

err_dw_dma_probe:
    clk_disable_unprepare(chip->clk);
return err;
}

    of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node);

dw_dma_remove(chip);
clk_disable_unprepare(chip->clk);

return 0;
}
```
