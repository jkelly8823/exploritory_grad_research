VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No discernible vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, we did not identify any potential security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a part of a power management system and involves manipulation of measured residency values. It uses several if-conditions and arithmetic operations to handle the values, but doesn't have any obvious vulnerabilities. The code is defensive in nature as it correctly handles expected values and edge cases.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were identified, no specific recommendations are provided. However, it is crucial to review and analyze the entire codebase to ensure overall security.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    * power state and occurrence of the wakeup event.
    *
    * If the entered idle state didn't support residency measurements,
    * we use them anyway if they are short, and if long,
    * truncate to the whole expected time.
    *
    * Any measured amount of time will include the exit latency.
    * Since we are interested in when the wakeup begun, not when it
    * was completed, we must subtract the exit latency. However, if
    * the measured amount of time is less than the exit latency,
    * assume the state was never reached and the exit latency is 0.
