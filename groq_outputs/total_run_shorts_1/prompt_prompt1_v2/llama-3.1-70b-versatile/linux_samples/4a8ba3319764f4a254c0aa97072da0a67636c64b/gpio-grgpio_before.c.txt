VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unvalidated user-controlled data usage in printk
EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the format string used in `dev_info` function call contains `%s` placeholder for an entirely user-controlled string 'irqs'. Although the `%s` placeholder is used to print a string and might not lead directly to memory corruption in this case, usage of malformed string formats can potentially cause issues with the string formatting, potentially resulting in crashes, information leaks, or errors that might lead to further vulnerabilities. It is recommended to ensure that the data provided for `%s` is sanitized and should not contain formatting directives, in this case 'irqs' should contain plain text.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid potential format string vulnerabilities, you should replace `%s` placeholder with any placeholder that does not interpret the provided string (e.g., `%.*s`) or ensure that 'irqs' string does not contain any formatting directives by manually filtering the string or printing a formatted message prior to adding any user-controlled data. However, without knowing the full context of what 'irqs' is used for in the rest of the codebase and because removing or replacing this placeholder my change the output of the log message, we would recommend instead ensuring 'irqs' does not contain formatting directives.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
err = gpiochip_add(gc);
if (err) {
	dev_err(&ofdev->dev, "Could not add gpiochip\n");
	irq_domain_remove(priv->domain);
	return err;
}

dev_info(&ofdev->dev, "regs=0x%p, base=%d, ngpio=%d, irqs=%s\n",
```
