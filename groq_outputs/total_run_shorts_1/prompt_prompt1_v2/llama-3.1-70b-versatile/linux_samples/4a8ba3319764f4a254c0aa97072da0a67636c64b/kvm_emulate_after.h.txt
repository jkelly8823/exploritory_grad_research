VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation for ARM architecture. The `vcpu_reset_hcr` function resets the HCR (Hypervisor Configuration Register) for a given VCPU, and the `vcpu_pc` function returns the program counter for a given VCPU. Upon analyzing the code, no potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use of insecure functions were detected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as no vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static inline void vcpu_reset_hcr(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
	vcpu->arch.hcr_el2 = HCR_GUEST_FLAGS;
	if (test_bit(KVM_ARM_VCPU_EL1_32BIT, vcpu->arch.features))
		vcpu->arch.hcr_el2 &= ~HCR_RW;
}

static inline unsigned long *vcpu_pc(const struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{```
Note: The second function `vcpu_pc` seems incomplete, but as per your instruction, we are ignoring warnings or issues that stem from incomplete code.
