VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
None detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a section of a Linux kernel source file, specifically related to ARM GIC interrupt controller and OMAP soc handling. It checks if OMAP secure APIs are supported and if so, it calls a function to set the auxiliary core boot address. If not, it writes the physical address of the secondary startup code to a specific memory location. There are no obvious indications of vulnerabilities in this code, such as unvalidated user input, potential buffer overflows, or insecure memory operations. However, a more thorough analysis of the entire codebase would be necessary to rule out potential issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/irqchip/arm-gic.h>

#include <asm/smp_scu.h>

#include "omap-secure.h"
#include "omap-wakeupgen.h"
#include <asm/cputype.h>
	if (omap_secure_apis_support())
		omap_auxcoreboot_addr(virt_to_phys(startup_addr));
	else
		writel_relaxed(virt_to_phys(omap5_secondary_startup),
			       base + OMAP_AUX_CORE_BOOT_1);
