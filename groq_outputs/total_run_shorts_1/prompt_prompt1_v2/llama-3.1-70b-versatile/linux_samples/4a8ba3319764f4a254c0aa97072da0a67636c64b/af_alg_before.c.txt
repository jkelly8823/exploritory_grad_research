VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of Unvalidated Input (`err`) that can lead to a potential information disclosure or data corruption.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a completion handler for an asynchronous operation. It takes `err`, likely an error code, from the request context and assigns it to `completion->err`. The `err` value is not validated or checked for its range before being assigned.

This can lead to several potential issues. If the value of `err` is negative and greater than `INT_MIN`, this can result in a potential information disclosure as it can expose internal data. In other cases, it may lead to data corruption when `err` is assigned to `completion->err`, potentially allowing an attacker to control the value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Validate or sanitize `err` value before assigning it to `completion->err`. This can be achieved by using error handling mechanisms or explicit bounds checking for valid error codes.
Additionally, perform bounds checking for `err` to ensure it does not exceed `INT_MAX` to prevent potential overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
	struct af_alg_completion *completion = req->data;

	completion->err = err;
	complete(&completion->completion);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(af_alg_complete);
