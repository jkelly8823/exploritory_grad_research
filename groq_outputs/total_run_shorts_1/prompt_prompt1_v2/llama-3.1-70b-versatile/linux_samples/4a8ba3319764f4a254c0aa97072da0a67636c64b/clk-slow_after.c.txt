VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double-Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
In the `clk_slow_osc_prepare` function, there are duplicate lines of code that attempt to register a clock (`clk = clk_register(NULL, &slowck->hw);`) and handle potential errors. The problematic lines are outside the function's scope and seem to be a duplicate of the inner function code. This can lead to a double-free vulnerability if `clk_register` fails and `slowck` is freed twice in case of an error. Additionally, we can't determine the scope of `slowck` in this code snippet, but if it's allocated dynamically, freeing it without checking if it's NULL can result in undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the duplicate lines of code outside the `clk_slow_osc_prepare` function's scope.
2. Check if `slowck` is NULL before freeing it.
3. Ensure that `slowck` is not freed elsewhere in the code if it's allocated dynamically.
4. Initialize `clk` to NULL and check its value before performing operations to prevent unintentional dereferences.

ORIGINAL CODE:


#define to_clk_sam9x5_slow(hw) container_of(hw, struct clk_sam9x5_slow, hw)

static struct clk *slow_clk;

static int clk_slow_osc_prepare(struct clk_hw *hw)
{
	struct clk_slow_osc *osc = to_clk_slow_osc(hw);
	clk = clk_register(NULL, &slowck->hw);
	if (IS_ERR(clk))
		kfree(slowck);
	else
		slow_clk = clk;

	return clk;
}

	clk = clk_register(NULL, &slowck->hw);
	if (IS_ERR(clk))
		kfree(slowck);
	else
		slow_clk = clk;

	return clk;
}


	of_clk_add_provider(np, of_clk_src_simple_get, clk);
}

/*
 * FIXME: All slow clk users are not properly claiming it (get + prepare +
 * enable) before using it.
 * If all users properly claiming this clock decide that they don't need it
 * anymore (or are removed), it is disabled while faulty users are still
 * requiring it, and the system hangs.
 * Prevent this clock from being disabled until all users are properly
 * requesting it.
 * Once this is done we should remove this function and the slow_clk variable.
