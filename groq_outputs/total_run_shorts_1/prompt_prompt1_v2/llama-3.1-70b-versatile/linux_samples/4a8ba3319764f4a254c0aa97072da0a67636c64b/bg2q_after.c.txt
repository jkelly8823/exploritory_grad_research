VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not find any potential vulnerabilities. The code appears to define a few clock frequencies for various peripherals (pbridge, sdio, nfc, pcie) and declares a function berlin2q_clock_setup. There are no suspicious patterns or unsafe operations that could indicate a potential vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{ "pbridge",	"perif",	15, CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED },
{ "sdio",	"perif",	16, CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED },
{ "nfc",	"perif",	18 },
{ "pcie",	"perif",	22 },
};
static void __init berlin2q_clock_setup(struct device_node *np)
