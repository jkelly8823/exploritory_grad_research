VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a simple array of structures, with each structure containing a vendor and device ID from the PCI_VDEVICE macro, and an associated board type. There is no apparent vulnerability in this code, as it does not involve any dynamic data parsing, user input, memory allocation, or other potentially exploitable operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No changes are recommended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
