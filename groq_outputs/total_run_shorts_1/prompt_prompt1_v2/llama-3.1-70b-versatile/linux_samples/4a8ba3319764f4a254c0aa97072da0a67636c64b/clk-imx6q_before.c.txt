VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be assigning values to variables and initializing clock structures. The code seems to be handling indices and memory allocations properly. There is no apparent use of untrusted input, no clear buffer overflow, and no obvious data corruption. The operations are straightforward, and the code does not seem to be vulnerable to any common security weaknesses within the confines of the given snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are required as no vulnerability was found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	post_div_table[1].div = 1;
	post_div_table[2].div = 1;
	video_div_table[1].div = 1;
	video_div_table[2].div = 1;
}
