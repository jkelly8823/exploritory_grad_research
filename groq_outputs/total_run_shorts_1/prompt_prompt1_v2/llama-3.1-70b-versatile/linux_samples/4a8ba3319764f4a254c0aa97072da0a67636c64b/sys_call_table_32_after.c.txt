VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities. The code snippet defines a system call table with a single entry for an unimplemented system call. The table uses the ____cacheline_aligned attribute to ensure proper alignment of the table, which is not a vulnerability. The code also includes a comment about a potential compiler bug, but the current code does not indicate any vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are required for this code snippet as it does not contain any identifiable vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern asmlinkage void sys_ni_syscall(void);

const sys_call_ptr_t sys_call_table[] ____cacheline_aligned = {
	/*
	 * Smells like a compiler bug -- it doesn't work
	 * when the & below is removed.
	 */
```
