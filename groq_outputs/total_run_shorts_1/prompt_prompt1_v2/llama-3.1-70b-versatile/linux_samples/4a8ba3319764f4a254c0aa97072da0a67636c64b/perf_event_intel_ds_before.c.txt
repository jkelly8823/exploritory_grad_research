VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to define an array of event constraints for a specific hardware event monitoring system (such as Intel Processor Trace). 

The given code does not contain any user-input handling or access, it's not performing any operations involving critical resources or complex logical calculations, nor does it seem to manage any objects, which reduces the likelihood of code safety vulnerabilities.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It is properly formatted and the functions, such as `INTEL_FLAGS_EVENT_CONSTRAINT`, are assumed to be declared and implemented correctly elsewhere.


ORIGINAL CODE:
};
struct event_constraint intel_slm_pebs_event_constraints[] = {
	/* UOPS_RETIRED.ALL, inv=1, cmask=16 (cycles:p). */
	INTEL_FLAGS_EVENT_CONSTRAINT(0x108001c2, 0xf),
	/* Allow all events as PEBS with no flags */
	INTEL_ALL_EVENT_CONSTRAINT(0, 0x1),
	EVENT_CONSTRAINT_END
};
