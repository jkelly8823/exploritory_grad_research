VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet does not contain any identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of the PowerPC kernel code for handling kexec functionality. It defines two extern functions and provides inline implementations for two other functions. Upon examination, no potential security vulnerabilities or issues were found in the provided code snippet. There are no buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or unvalidated user input that could be exploited. The code seems to be well-structured and follows good programming practices.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed in this case, as no identified vulnerabilities were found. However, it is always a good practice to thoroughly review and test the code as part of the overall project to ensure its security and integrity.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern void reserve_crashkernel(void);
extern void machine_kexec_mask_interrupts(void);

#else /* !CONFIG_KEXEC */
static inline void crash_kexec_secondary(struct pt_regs *regs) { }

static inline int overlaps_crashkernel(unsigned long start, unsigned long size)
	return 0;
}

#endif /* CONFIG_KEXEC */
#endif /* ! __ASSEMBLY__ */
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
#endif /* _ASM_POWERPC_KEXEC_H */
