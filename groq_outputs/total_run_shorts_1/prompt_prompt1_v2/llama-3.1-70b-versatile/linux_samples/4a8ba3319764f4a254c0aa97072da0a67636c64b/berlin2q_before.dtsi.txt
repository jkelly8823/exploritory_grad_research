VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be written in Device Tree Source (DTS) format, which is used to describe hardware components and their configurations in Linux. I have analyzed the code and did not find any vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of buffer overflows, memory leaks, or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations can be provided since no vulnerabilities were detected. This code snippet appears to be a legitimate DTS configuration file.
ORIGINAL CODE:
 The original code was as follows-

			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 28 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			clocks = <&chip CLKID_SDIO1XIN>;
			status = "disabled";
		};
