VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure external function usage

EXPLANATION:
The function omap2_get_l3_device() is declared but its implementation is not provided in the given code snippet. It is declared as an external function which potentially could be defined elsewhere in the project. However, this is an insecure practice as it potentially allows unauthorized access to any device. 
This usage could be problematic since it may enable external code to access devices, including those with elevated privilege levels. For this reason, using non-const global variables as function arguments is problematic. Without access to compilation options for which devices this code is compiled on, insecure device access analysis proves harder. Furthermore, its pointer return type potentially allows any arbitrary memory locations, meaning given a properly formatted input for this function insecure arbitrary memory locations read access could prove possible on any arbitrary device.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Make it clear that the implementation of omap2_get_l3_device() should be made directly in this file or the code implementation file location be specified. Move as many symbols as possible into separate files into unique headers that include enough description so anyone maintaining the code after may locate required elements.  We should also use software static analysis testing such as Taintgrind with Valgrind, which are able to discover memory errors such as buffer overflows at runtime and provide locations within the executable to increase software security assurance. These steps ensure proper tracking so any usage by code later down the development cycle would then increase the success possibility if you desire or otherwise to incorporate formal correctness software proof in hardware for your code implementation.

#endif

#if defined(CONFIG_SMP) && defined(CONFIG_PM)
