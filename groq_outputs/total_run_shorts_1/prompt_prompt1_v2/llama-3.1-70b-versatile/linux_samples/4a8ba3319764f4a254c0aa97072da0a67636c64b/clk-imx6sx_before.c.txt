VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a section of a device driver or low-level hardware initialization code, written in C. It sets the parents of some clocks and initializes the power mode. No obvious vulnerabilities were detected, such as buffer overflows, use of untrusted input, or invalid memory access. The code does not seem to handle user input or communicate with external entities in a way that could introduce vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided, as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
clk_set_parent(clks[IMX6SX_CLK_GPU_CORE_SEL], clks[IMX6SX_CLK_PLL3_PFD0]);
clk_set_parent(clks[IMX6SX_CLK_GPU_AXI_SEL], clks[IMX6SX_CLK_PLL3_PFD0]);

/* Set initial power mode */
imx6q_set_lpm(WAIT_CLOCKED);
}
CLK_OF_DECLARE(imx6sx, "fsl,imx6sx-ccm", imx6sx_clocks_init);
```
