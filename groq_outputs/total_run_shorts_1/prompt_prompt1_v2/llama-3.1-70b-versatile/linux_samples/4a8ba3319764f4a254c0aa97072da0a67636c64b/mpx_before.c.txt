VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet does not exhibit any obvious vulnerability within the given code. 
However, considering that we've only been presented with a snippet of code and have not been given the complete context, 
this assessment may be subject to revision upon presentation of the full code.


EXPLANATION:
After examining the code snippet, no clear-cut vulnerabilities could be identified within the supplied context. 
However, there are some potential indicators for concern that aren't code snippet supplied; 
Some important examples include unchecked input going to the xsave, missing validation for buffer overflow 
when performing the xsave and the missing try-catch mechanism.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Check if inputs are properly validated before calling the 'cpu_feature_enabled' function. 
Ensure there's memory safety and alignment concerning CPU context use. Before supplying data for processing,
it should undergo safe memory addressing mechanisms.
Furthermore, the system should have some kind of error checking. Once completed, we'd inspect all 
of the Xsave commands again.


ORIGINAL CODE:
	if (!cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_MPX))
		return MPX_INVALID_BOUNDS_DIR;

	/*
	 * The bounds directory pointer is stored in a register
	 * only accessible if we first do an xsave.
