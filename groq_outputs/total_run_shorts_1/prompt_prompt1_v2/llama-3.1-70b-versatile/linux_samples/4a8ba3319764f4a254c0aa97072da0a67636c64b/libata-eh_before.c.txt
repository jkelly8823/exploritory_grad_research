VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No discernible vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a comment block and a function signature, which does not contain any logic that can be exploited for a security vulnerability. The function's purpose is to report error handling, but without any implementation details, it's impossible to identify any potential issues.

Additionally, there's a return statement outside a function body which seems out of place, but without more context, this can't be confirmed as a vulnerability.

Since the code snippet lacks the implementation of the function and any potential vulnerabilities cannot be identified, this code is considered not vulnerable based on the information provided.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
With the given code snippet, no recommendations for fixing any vulnerabilities can be provided as none were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
