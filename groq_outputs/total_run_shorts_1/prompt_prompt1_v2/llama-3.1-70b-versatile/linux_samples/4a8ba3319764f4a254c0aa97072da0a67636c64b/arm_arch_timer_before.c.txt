VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of externally-influenced pointer values without validation.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet assigns the address of either `arch_counter_get_cntvct` or `arch_counter_get_cntpct` to the `arch_timer_read_counter` pointer based on the `arch_timer_use_virtual` variable. However, this variable's source and validation are not provided within the snippet, and potential tampering with its value could result in insecure assignment to `arch_timer_read_counter`. If `arch_timer_use_virtual` is externally controlled or influenced by untrusted data, it could lead to a vulnerability such as arbitrary function execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure this code snippet, the following steps should be taken:
1. Validate the source of `arch_timer_use_virtual` to ensure it is not externally influencable or influenced by untrusted data. 
2. Ensure `arch_timer_use_virtual` is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any potential exploitation. 
3. Consider using safe switching or lookup mechanisms in place of externally controlled pointer assignment.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    /* Register the CP15 based counter if we have one */
    if (type & ARCH_CP15_TIMER) {
        if (arch_timer_use_virtual)
            arch_timer_read_counter = arch_counter_get_cntvct;
        else
            arch_timer_read_counter = arch_counter_get_cntpct;
    } else
