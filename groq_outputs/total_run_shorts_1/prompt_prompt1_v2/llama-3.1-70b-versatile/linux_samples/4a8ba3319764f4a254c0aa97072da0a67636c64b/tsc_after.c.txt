VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet does not contain any apparent security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be part of a larger function and seems to be handling an error condition where fast TSC calibration has failed. The use of `goto` statements can potentially lead to bugs if not used correctly, but in this case, the code is simply jumping to a labeled location (`success`) when the function should exit normally.

However, it's worth noting that the `goto` statement itself is not inherently a vulnerability. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to accurately assess the potential risks associated with this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
			goto success;
		}
	}
	pr_info("Fast TSC calibration failed\n");
	return 0;

success:
