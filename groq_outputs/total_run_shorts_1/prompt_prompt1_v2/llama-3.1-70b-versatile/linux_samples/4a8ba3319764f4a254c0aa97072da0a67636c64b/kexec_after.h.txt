VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unintended branch prediction behavior when returning from the inline function.
EXPLANATION: 
The potential issue lies in the `overlaps_crashkernel` function. The function's return type is declared as `int`, but it does not contain a valid `return` statement. However, in this specific case, the concern arises from its inline nature and how it always returns 0. Since the `return` statement is missing an actual semicolon, this will cause compiler errors. A more critical concern is that attackers could potentially manipulate branch prediction when calling the function to potentially disclose sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
The provided code snippet is only a part of the actual file. However, considering the shown snippet, modify the function to include a proper semicolon at the end of the return statement to fix the syntax error.

 Change this: 
```c
static inline int overlaps_crashkernel(unsigned long start, unsigned long size)
    return 0;
```
 to 
```c
static inline int overlaps_crashkernel(unsigned long start, unsigned long size)
{
    return 0;
}
```

Considering the bigger picture, the return statement should probably do more than just return zero for an actual check for overlapping regions.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
extern void reserve_crashkernel(void);
extern void machine_kexec_mask_interrupts(void);

static inline bool kdump_in_progress(void)
{
    return crashing_cpu >= 0;
}

#else /* !CONFIG_KEXEC */
static inline void crash_kexec_secondary(struct pt_regs *regs) { }

static inline int overlaps_crashkernel(unsigned long start, unsigned long size)
    return 0;
}

static inline bool kdump_in_progress(void)
{
    return false;
}

#endif /* CONFIG_KEXEC */
#endif /* ! __ASSEMBLY__ */
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
#endif /* _ASM_POWERPC_KEXEC_H */
```
