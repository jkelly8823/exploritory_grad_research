VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be defining a struct containing various 32-bit and 64-bit unsigned integer variables, likely representing CPU registers. The DECLARE_PER_CPU macro is also used to allocate per-CPU storage for an instance of the 'cpuinfo_arm64' struct.

No obvious vulnerabilities or potential exploits were identified in this snippet. The code seems to be defining a data structure and allocating memory for it, which is a common and benign operation in kernel or low-level system programming.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for remediation are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
