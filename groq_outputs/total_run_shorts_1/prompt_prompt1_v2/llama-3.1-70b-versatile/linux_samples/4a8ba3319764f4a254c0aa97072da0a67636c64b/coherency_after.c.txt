VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No critical vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet consists of a couple of functions and a function declaration. However, there's no apparent indication of a vulnerability such as buffer overflow, SQL injection, path traversal, etc. The `coherency_available` and `coherency_init` functions seem to be returning proper results for their context and do not appear to pose a security threat. There's no sign of untrusted input being treated as trusted, no sensitive data leaks, or use-after-free scenarios present in the snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
return type;
}

/*
 * As a precaution, we currently completely disable hardware I/O
 * coherency, until enough testing is done with automatic I/O
 * synchronization barriers to validate that it is a proper solution.
 */
int coherency_available(void)
{
	return false;
}

int __init coherency_init(void)
