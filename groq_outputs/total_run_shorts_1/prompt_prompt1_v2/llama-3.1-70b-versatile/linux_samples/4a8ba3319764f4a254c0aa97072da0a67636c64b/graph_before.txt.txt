ORIGINAL CODE:
may be described by specialized bindings depending on the type of connection.

To see how this binding applies to video pipelines, for example, see
Documentation/device-tree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
Here the ports describe data interfaces, and the links between them are
the connecting data buses. A single port with multiple connections can
correspond to multiple devices being connected to the same physical bus.
