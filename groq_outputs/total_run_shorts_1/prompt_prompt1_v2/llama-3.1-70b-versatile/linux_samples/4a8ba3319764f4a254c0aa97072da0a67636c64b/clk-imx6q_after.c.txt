VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be written in C and is used to set values in an array. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code. The code does not contain any user input, no pointer arithmetic that could potentially lead to buffer overflow, no dynamically allocated memory, and does not seem to perform any operations that could lead to a common vulnerability.

However, without seeing the rest of the code, it's impossible to rule out any potential issues. For example, we do not know what the `imx_clk_mux` function does or what its parameters represent, so we cannot say for certain that this is not vulnerable to something like a buffer overflow.

That being said, based on the information provided, we can find no vulnerabilities in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are made, as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	post_div_table[1].div = 1;
	post_div_table[2].div = 1;
	video_div_table[1].div = 1;
	video_div_table[3].div = 1;
}

 clk[IMX6QDL_PLL1_BYPASS_SRC] = imx_clk_mux("pll1_bypass_src", base + 0x00, 14, 2, pll_bypass_src_sels, ARRAY_SIZE(pll_bypass_src_sels));
 clk[IMX6QDL_PLL2_BYPASS_SRC] = imx_clk_mux("pll2_bypass_src", base + 0x30, 14, 2, pll_bypass_src_sels, ARRAY_SIZE(pll_bypass_src_sels));
