VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a series of system call numbers for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. These definitions appear to be part of a system call table and do not perform any operations, but instead serve as constants. Given this context, no vulnerabilities were detected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, depending on the location of this code and the system as a whole, proper input validation and error handling is recommended for functions that will utilize these system call numbers.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
#define __NR_bpf		351
#define __NR_s390_pci_mmio_write	352
#define __NR_s390_pci_mmio_read		353
#define NR_syscalls 354

/* 
 * There are some system calls that are not present on 64 bit, some
 * have a different name although they do the same (e.g. __NR_chown32
