VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure function call due to missing error checking
EXPLANATION:
The `kexec_prepare_cpus()` function may fail in certain scenarios. However, this code does not check the return value of the `kexec_prepare_cpus()` call. This is problematic because the `kexec_prepare_cpus()` function is important for preparing the system for a kexec operation. If it fails and the error is not checked or handled, the system may be left in an inconsistent state, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes when the kexec operation is attempted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Check the return value of the `kexec_prepare_cpus()` call and handle any error that may occur. For example:

```c
if (crashing_cpu == -1) {
    int ret = kexec_prepare_cpus();
    if (ret) {
        /* handle error */
    }
}
```
This ensures that if an error occurs while preparing the CPUs for kexec, it will be properly handled and the system will not be left in an inconsistent state.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (crashing_cpu == -1)
    kexec_prepare_cpus();

pr_debug("kexec: Starting switchover sequence.\n");
