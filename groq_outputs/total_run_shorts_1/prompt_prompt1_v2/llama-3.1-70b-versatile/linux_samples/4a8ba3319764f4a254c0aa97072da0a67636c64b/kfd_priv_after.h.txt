VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet does not contain any immediately apparent vulnerabilities. It consists mainly of function and structure declarations, which do not typically pose a direct risk of security vulnerabilities. While it is possible that there may be vulnerabilities when these functions and structures are implemented, the declarations themselves are benign.
RECOMMENDATIONS: No recommended fixes for this code.
