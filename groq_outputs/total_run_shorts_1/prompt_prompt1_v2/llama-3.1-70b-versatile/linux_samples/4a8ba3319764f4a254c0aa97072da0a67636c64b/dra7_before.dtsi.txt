VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a configuration section of a Device Tree file (DTB), which is used to describe the hardware components of a system. The code sets properties for several OMAP DWC3 controllers, such as transmission FIFO resize, maximum speed, and dual-role mode. There is no indication of vulnerability in this configuration data, as it doesn't involve any sensitive data handling or control flow that could be exploited.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as the code does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities.
