VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
I have analyzed the provided code snippet and have not identified any potential vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a simple module initialization and exit function registration, along with a cryptographic alias definition. All operations seem to be defined and called correctly, with no obvious issues with data processing or potential security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, there are no recommendations for this code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
module_init(prng_mod_init);
