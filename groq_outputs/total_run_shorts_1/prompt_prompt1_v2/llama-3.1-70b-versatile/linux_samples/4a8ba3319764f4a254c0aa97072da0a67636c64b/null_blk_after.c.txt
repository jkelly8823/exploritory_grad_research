VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No obvious vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a larger function, likely responsible for initializing queues in a Linux block device driver. The code checks the queue mode and initializes the queue accordingly, handling potential errors by checking the return value of `blk_mq_init_queue()`. The code also properly handles error paths by assigning a return value and jumping to cleanup labels.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are provided, as no vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
goto out_cleanup_queues;

nullb->q = blk_mq_init_queue(&nullb->tag_set);
if (IS_ERR(nullb->q)) {
    rv = -ENOMEM;
    goto out_cleanup_tags;
}
} else if (queue_mode == NULL_Q_BIO) {
```
