VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not find any apparent vulnerabilities. The code snippet appears to be part of a larger module system and consists of two function definitions for managing trampolines. The functions seem to be properly defined and do not contain any obvious security risks.

However, I would like to note that without context about the `module_memfree` function, it is impossible to determine its safety. Additionally, the `alloc_tramp` function seems to be allocating memory, but it is not immediately apparent where the free function is or if it is properly handling potential allocation failures.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Given the limited scope of the provided code snippet, no specific recommendations can be made. However, in a larger context, I would recommend:

* Verifying the implementation of `module_memfree` to ensure it properly handles memory deallocation.
* Implementing proper error handling for the `alloc_tramp` function, including checking for allocation failures.
* Ensuring that the trampoline allocation and deallocation functions are properly synchronized in a multi-threaded environment.

ORIGINAL CODE:
}
static inline void tramp_free(void *tramp)
{
	module_memfree(tramp);
}
#else
/* Trampolines can only be created if modules are supported */
static inline void *alloc_tramp(unsigned long size)
