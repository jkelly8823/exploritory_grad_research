VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that handles CPU-related functionality. It checks if the CPU has a 32-bit EL1 using the `cpu_has_32bit_el1` function and sets the `cpu_reset` pointer accordingly. The logic is straightforward and does not appear to introduce any security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (!cpu_has_32bit_el1())
    return -EINVAL;
cpu_reset = &default_regs_reset32;
} else {
    cpu_reset = &default_regs_reset;
}
```
