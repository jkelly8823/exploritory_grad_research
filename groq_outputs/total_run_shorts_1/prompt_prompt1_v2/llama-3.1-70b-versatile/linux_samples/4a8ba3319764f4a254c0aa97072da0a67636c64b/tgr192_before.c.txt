VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
N/A, however, this section was included for format.
The potential issue is not insecure, but has the potential to cause other issues.
EXPLANATION:
Although this code does not show any security vulnerabilities in the classical sense, there is one potential issue worth noting: The module aliases two different hash algorithms, "tgr160" and "tgr128", which are not defined in the code snippet provided. 

However, there is a module initialization for "tgr192_mod_init", which may not be associated with either of these aliases. This may suggest an inconsistency in the module initialization and aliases.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code thoroughly to ensure that the module aliases correctly match the module initialization and the algorithms being aliased. 
- Consider logging or debugging messages to help diagnose issues that might arise from this potential inconsistency.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    crypto_unregister_shashes(tgr_algs, ARRAY_SIZE(tgr_algs));
}

MODULE_ALIAS_CRYPTO("tgr160");
MODULE_ALIAS_CRYPTO("tgr128");

module_init(tgr192_mod_init);
