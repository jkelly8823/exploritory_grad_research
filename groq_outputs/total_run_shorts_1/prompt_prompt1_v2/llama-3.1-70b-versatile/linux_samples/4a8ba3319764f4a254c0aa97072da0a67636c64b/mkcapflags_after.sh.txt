VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a shell injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The line `VALUE="$(echo "$i" | sed -n 's@.*/\* *\("[^"]*"\).*\*/@\1@p')"` is vulnerable to shell injection. This is because the variable `i` is not sanitized before being passed to `echo`, and from there its output is parsed by `sed`. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the pipeline. 

While this appears to be parsing a c-style comment block, an untrusted comment block containing the `\*` characters could lead to malicious results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The `echo` command should be replaced with a safer method to parse the string. In this case, using `printf` would remove the potential for shell injection:
```bash
VALUE="$(printf '%s' "$i" | sed -n 's@.*/\* *\("[^"]*"\).*\*/@\1@p')"
```

However, the command is still vulnerable to injection attacks if the data coming from `i` is untrusted. In the best case scenario, you should inspect `i` and make sure it does not contain malicious input. Additionally, look into your regular expression and see if there is any regex injection that could be utilized by a malicious actor.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
        # If the /* comment */ starts with a quote string, grab that.
        VALUE="$(echo "$i" | sed -n 's@.*/\* *\("[^"]*"\).*\*/@\1@p')"
        [ -z "$VALUE" ] && VALUE="\"$NAME\""
        [ "$VALUE" = '""' ] && continue

        # Name is uppercase, VALUE is all lowercase
        VALUE="$(echo "$VALUE" | tr A-Z a-z)"
```
