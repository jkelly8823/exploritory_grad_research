VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities identified.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a conditional check within a larger function, specifically checking for the status of certain CPU features and thread flags. It does not contain any evident vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or use-after-free bugs. The logic is simple and does not involve any unexpected user input.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (!cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_MPX))
	return MPX_INVALID_BOUNDS_DIR;

/*
 * 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels are currently
 * unsupported.
 */
if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86_64) && test_thread_flag(TIF_IA32))
	return MPX_INVALID_BOUNDS_DIR;
/*
 * The bounds directory pointer is stored in a register
 * only accessible if we first do an xsave.
 */
