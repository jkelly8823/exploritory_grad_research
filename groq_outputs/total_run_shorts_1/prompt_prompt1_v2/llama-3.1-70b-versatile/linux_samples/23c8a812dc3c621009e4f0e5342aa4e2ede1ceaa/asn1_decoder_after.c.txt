VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability when handling lengths greater than 0x80.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks the validity of lengths greater than 0x80 by verifying that it doesn't exceed the available data length (`n > datalen - dp`), and then constructs the length by reading multiple bytes from the data. However, it doesn't verify if the constructed length exceeds the remaining data buffer size. If an attacker provides a specially crafted input, they might be able to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this issue, additional checks should be performed to verify that the constructed length doesn't exceed the remaining data buffer size. For example:

```c
if (len < 0 || len > datalen - dp) {
    // Handle error: invalid or overflowed length
    goto data_overrun_error;
}
```

This check should be added after the loop that constructs the `len` variable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
    /* Extract a tag from the data */
    tag = data[dp++];
    if (tag == ASN1_EOC) {
        /* It appears to be an EOC. */
        if (data[dp++] != 0)
            goto invalid_eoc;
        if (--indef_level <= 0) {

    /* Extract the length */
    len = data[dp++];
    if (len <= 0x7f)
        goto check_length;

    if (unlikely(len == ASN1_INDEFINITE_LENGTH)) {
        /* Indefinite length */
        if (unlikely((tag & ASN1_CONS_BIT) == ASN1_PRIM << 5))
    }

    n = len - 0x80;
    if (unlikely(n > sizeof(len) - 1))
        goto length_too_long;
    if (unlikely(n > datalen - dp))
        goto data_overrun_error;
    len = 0;
    for (; n > 0; n--) {
        len <<= 8;
        len |= data[dp++];
    }
check_length:
    if (len > datalen - dp)
        goto data_overrun_error;
    dp += len;
    goto next_tag;
