VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No evident vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel function that checks for certain conditions related to process execution. The function checks if the process has no new privileges (nnp) or if the mount point does not allow suid (nosuid). If neither condition is met, the function returns 0. The code does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or other types of attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
const struct task_security_struct *new_tsec)
{
	int nnp = (bprm->unsafe & LSM_UNSAFE_NO_NEW_PRIVS);
	int nosuid = !mnt_may_suid(bprm->file->f_path.mnt);
	int rc;

	if (!nnp && !nosuid)
		return 0; /* neither NNP nor nosuid */
```
