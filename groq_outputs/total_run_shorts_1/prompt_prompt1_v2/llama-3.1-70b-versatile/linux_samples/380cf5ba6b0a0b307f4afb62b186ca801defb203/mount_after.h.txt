VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet consists of several function declarations for working with vfsmount and path structures, likely part of a Linux kernel module. Upon reviewing these declarations, no vulnerabilities were identified. These functions appear to be implementing standard operations related to mounts and permissions. Since the functions declared here do not have any executable code, it is not possible to assess potential security risks that might arise from function logic.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are required as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern struct vfsmount *mntget(struct vfsmount *mnt);
extern struct vfsmount *mnt_clone_internal(struct path *path);
extern int __mnt_is_readonly(struct vfsmount *mnt);
extern bool mnt_may_suid(struct vfsmount *mnt);

struct path;
extern struct vfsmount *clone_private_mount(struct path *path);
```
