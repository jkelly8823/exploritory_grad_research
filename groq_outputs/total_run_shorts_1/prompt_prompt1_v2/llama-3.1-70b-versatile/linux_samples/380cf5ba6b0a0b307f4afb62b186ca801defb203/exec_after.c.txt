VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential elevation of privileges vulnerability due to insecure use of current_euid and current_egid.

EXPLANATION:
The code assigns the result of current_euid() and current_egid() to bprm->cred->euid and bprm->cred->egid respectively. This can potentially elevate privileges since it uses the current effective user ID, which may have higher privileges than the real user ID. This could allow an attacker to exploit this code by executing a binary with elevated privileges.

Additionally, mnt_may_suid and task_no_new_privs checks do not prevent the execution of the code, but only control the conditions under which it is executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use more secure methods of obtaining user IDs, such as using credentials that have been explicitly set by a secure authentication mechanism. 

Additionally, consider using the following methods to obtain user IDs: 
- get_current_uid() instead of current_euid() for getting the current real user ID.
- get_current_gid() instead of current_egid() for getting the current real group ID.

It is also recommended to add additional checks or logging to detect and respond to potential security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	bprm->cred->euid = current_euid();
	bprm->cred->egid = current_egid();

	if (!mnt_may_suid(bprm->file->f_path.mnt))
		return;

	if (task_no_new_privs(current))
		return;
