ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern struct vfsmount *mntget(struct vfsmount *mnt);
extern struct vfsmount *mnt_clone_internal(struct path *path);
extern int __mnt_is_readonly(struct vfsmount *mnt);

struct path;
extern struct vfsmount *clone_private_mount(struct path *path);
```
Note: Please be aware that thorough security auditing of code typically involves a deep understanding of the code's functionality, the context in which it's executed, and a holistic assessment of its interactions with other components. A code snippet might be part of a larger system that has inherent security risks. This assessment is based solely on the provided code snippet and might not reflect the overall security posture of the codebase it's part of.
