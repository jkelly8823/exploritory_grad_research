VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability due to a potentially untrusted or unsanitized input being directly inserted into a system command string.

EXPLANATION:
The code presented is a system configuration file for a DNS resolver. However, in line 1, the resolver is calling a system command `/usr/sbin/dns.foo %k`. The `%k` is a placeholder for an unknown value, likely an untrusted input (e.g., a domain name from a user). If this input is not properly sanitized or validated, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that any inputs going into the `%k` placeholder are properly sanitized and validated to prevent injection of malicious commands. This may involve checking for specific characters or character sequences that are not allowed, and also ensuring that the input adheres to the expected format.

 ORIGINAL CODE:
create dns_resolver   foo:* * /usr/sbin/dns.foo %k
