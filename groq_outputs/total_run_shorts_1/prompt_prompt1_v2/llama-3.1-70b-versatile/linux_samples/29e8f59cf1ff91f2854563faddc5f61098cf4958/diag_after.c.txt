VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Possible Race Condition in Mutex Lock.
This vulnerability occurs when multiple threads are accessing shared resources in an incorrect order. 

EXPLANATION:
The sk_diag_fill function is called within a mutex lock, but this function itself takes another structure (skb) that could be modified simultaneous with calling netlink_net_capable and that can cause inconsistencies when nlmsg_end is called in sk_diag_fill.

However in sk_diag_fill skb is used in nlmsg_end(skb, nlh) after it's passed to sock_diag_put_filterinfo which means changes to sk_buff are stored before mutex_lock.

To make this sure - is sk in case where it goes under mutex_lock at the same time in different iteration it does need mutex-lock to avoid inconsistencies.

There is another very likely possibility where there's Deadlock vulnerability can arise if, mutex lock from the sk_diag_fill in skb and mutex from nlmsg_end calls upon same structure which eventually leads Deadlock.

Here mutex variable 'net' is locked in for the iteration its hold lock for socket -list.

The lines specifically implementing the Race condition- a lock placed before and socket sk iteration starts and is unlocked after mutex iteration.

An attempt to remove possible mutex issues to mutex-lock with skb->sk having similar sort to call which points to function nlmsg_endskb struct directly.

The results show an unusual pointer related skb -lock which then results with function sk_diag_fillskb.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
If this happens in order changes to this make this Deadlock free. 

Firstly review this first:  - Synchronization is probably needed when mutex lock has been used within the nlmsg_endskb struct.


1. Check mutex variable which occurs to resolve deadlock concerns - which nlmsg_end performs synchronization.

2. Ensure necessary step-by-step action on critical sections - that needs to be achieved and make lock necessary 'socket-sk-for' pointer in place.

3. Modify or add semaphores /flags signal if necessary - nlmsg_endskb mutex has issues. that means the synchronization issue makes necessary system by call like nlmsg_endskb or sk_diag_fill.
