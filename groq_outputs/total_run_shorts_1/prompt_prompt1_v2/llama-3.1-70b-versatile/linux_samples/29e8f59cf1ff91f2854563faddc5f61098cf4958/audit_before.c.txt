VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a fragment of an audit mechanism in a Linux system, primarily related to capability checks for audit control and writing. It ensures that only users with the necessary capabilities (CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL or CAP_AUDIT_WRITE) can perform specific actions. However, this code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities on its own.

The code checks for the necessary capabilities before permitting audit-related operations. The checks are performed in a sequential manner and follow a clear hierarchical structure, where higher-privileged capabilities are checked before lower-privileged ones. The code also sets an error code (-EPERM) when the required capabilities are missing.

I have not identified any obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet. However, it's essential to consider the larger context and potential interactions with other code fragments in the entire system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to follow good security practices. However, I recommend reviewing the overall audit mechanism and capability checks to ensure proper access control and security in the system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	if ((task_active_pid_ns(current) != &init_pid_ns))
		return -EPERM;

	if (!capable(CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL))
		err = -EPERM;
	break;
case AUDIT_USER:
case AUDIT_FIRST_USER_MSG ... AUDIT_LAST_USER_MSG:
case AUDIT_FIRST_USER_MSG2 ... AUDIT_LAST_USER_MSG2:
	if (!capable(CAP_AUDIT_WRITE))
		err = -EPERM;
	break;
default:  /* bad msg */
	err = -EINVAL;
