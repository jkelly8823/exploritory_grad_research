VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a netlink message handling function, specifically checking for validity of the message length and sender capabilities. The function returns immediately if the message length is invalid or the sender lacks the required capability (CAP_NET_ADMIN). There are no obvious vulnerabilities or potential security issues in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Given the apparent purpose and functionality of this code snippet, there are no specific recommendations to address security vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (nlh->nlmsg_len < sizeof(*nlh) || skb->len < nlh->nlmsg_len)
	return;

if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	RCV_SKB_FAIL(-EPERM);

/* Eventually we might send routing messages too */
```
