VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code appears to contain duplicate checks for capability permissions and duplicate calls to ASSERT_RTNL().

EXPLANATION:
Upon inspection of the code snippet, it is evident that the same checks for CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities are performed twice, as well as two calls to ASSERT_RTNL(). This is unnecessary as the same checks could be performed once and still provide the same functionality. This redundancy could potentially make the code more difficult to maintain, and it might even indicate a lack of consistency or control flow in the original code. Moreover, performing duplicate checks might have negligible but unnecessary performance overhead.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The duplicate checks should be removed, and only a single check for both CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability should be performed. Additionally, only a single call to ASSERT_RTNL() is needed. 

```c
int err;
u8 pnaddr;

if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) || !capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)) {
  return -EPERM;
}

ASSERT_RTNL();
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int err;
u8 pnaddr;

if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

ASSERT_RTNL();

int err;
u8 dst;

if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

ASSERT_RTNL();
```
