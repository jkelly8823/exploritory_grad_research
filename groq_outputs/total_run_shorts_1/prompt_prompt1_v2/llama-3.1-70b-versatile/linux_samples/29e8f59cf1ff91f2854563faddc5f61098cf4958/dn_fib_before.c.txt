VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate variable declaration and repeated code.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet has a duplicate declaration of the `attrs` array and the `err` variable. Additionally, the capability check and network comparison are repeated. This repetition is not only inefficient but also increases the risk of maintenance errors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The duplicate code should be removed to avoid potential issues. The corrected code should be refactored to only have one instance of the variable declarations and the repeated checks. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct nlattr *attrs[RTA_MAX+1];
int err;

if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!net_eq(net, &init_net))
	return -EINVAL;
struct nlattr *attrs[RTA_MAX+1];
int err;

if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!net_eq(net, &init_net))
	return -EINVAL;
```
