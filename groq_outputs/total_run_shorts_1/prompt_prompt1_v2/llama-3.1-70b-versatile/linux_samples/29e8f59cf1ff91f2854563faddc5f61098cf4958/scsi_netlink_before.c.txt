VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet checks the capability of the current process to perform administrative tasks using the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. If the capability is not present, an error code of -EPERM (Permission Denied) is set. The code appears to implement a basic access control mechanism, which is a good security practice. There are no indications of common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or command injection.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for improvements are necessary, as the provided code snippet does not contain any detectable vulnerabilities. However, it is essential to ensure that the capability check is sufficient for the requirements of the program and that the error handling is properly implemented throughout the codebase.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)) {
		err = -EPERM;
		goto next_msg;
	}
