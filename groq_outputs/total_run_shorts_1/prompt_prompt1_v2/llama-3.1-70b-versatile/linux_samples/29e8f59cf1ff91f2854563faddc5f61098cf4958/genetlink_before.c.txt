VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not display any obvious security vulnerabilities. It checks for administrative permissions and capability before allowing access to certain operations. The `capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)` function checks if the current process has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, which is a Unix kernel feature that allows for fine-grained control over system privileges. The code snippet appears to be part of a netlink-based access control system.

Additionally, the `if ((ops->flags & GENL_ADMIN_PERM))` statement checks the GENL_ADMIN_PERM bit in the `ops->flags` to ensure that only authorized operations are allowed.

The provided code snippet seems to be following proper access control practices to prevent potential security issues. However, without more context or additional code, it is impossible to be 100% certain that this code is completely secure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	return -EOPNOTSUPP;

	if ((ops->flags & GENL_ADMIN_PERM) &&
	    !capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
		return -EPERM;

	if ((nlh->nlmsg_flags & NLM_F_DUMP) == NLM_F_DUMP) {
		int rc;
```
