VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be checking for network capability permissions using the `netlink_capable` function and ensuring that the rtnl lock is held with `ASSERT_RTNL()`. The CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks are repeated, which might be unnecessary but does not pose a security vulnerability. However, this repeated check could potentially be a bug or an error if this code is intended to follow a different logic path depending on the capabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the duplicate checks for `netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN)` and `netlink_capable(skb, CAP_SYS_ADMIN)` to improve code clarity and efficiency. This makes the code easier to read and understand.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int err;
u8 pnaddr;

if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

ASSERT_RTNL();

int err;
u8 dst;

if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

ASSERT_RTNL();
```
