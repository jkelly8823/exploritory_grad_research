VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a Linux kernel netlink implementation. The code checks for the net_admin capability and ensures that the network namespace is the initial network namespace. The checks themselves are secure and properly check return values.

The repeated definitions of `attrs` and `err` are likely the result of the provided code snippet being incomplete or a mistake in code formatting. In the context of this analysis, these repeated definitions do not pose a security vulnerability.

The `netlink_capable` and `net_eq` functions are part of the Linux kernel's netlink implementation and are not directly vulnerable. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, this code snippet is properly checking for administrative capability and network namespace before performing actions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct nlattr *attrs[RTA_MAX+1];
int err;

if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!net_eq(net, &init_net))
	return -EINVAL;
struct nlattr *attrs[RTA_MAX+1];
int err;

if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;

if (!net_eq(net, &init_net))
	return -EINVAL;
