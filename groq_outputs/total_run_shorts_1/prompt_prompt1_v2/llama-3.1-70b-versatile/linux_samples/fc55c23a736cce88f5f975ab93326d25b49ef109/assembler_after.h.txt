VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from an unbounded or privileged instruction ("stmdb") that is capable of storing registers into memory. Without safe bounds checking or privledge separation, adversary-provided input has the potential to cause an unchecked write past a stack-allocated buffer's intended boundaries. Since the stack register ("sp") is directly involved, there is potential for attacker control of the function return and other registers, leading to arbitrary code execution.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

To mitigate this issue, use of securely-checked non-privileged stack storage instructions ("stmd") are suggested for protecting r0 through lr from potentially-exploitable privilege escalation. Here is an over-simplified mitigation of the introduced vulnerability code as follows:

```C
	// ...rest of macro or source as is ...
	macro asm_trace_hardirqs_off, save=1
	// ... rest of macros or source as is...
	.if \save
	stmd   sp!, {r0-r3, ip, lr}
	// ... rest of macros or source as is...
```
