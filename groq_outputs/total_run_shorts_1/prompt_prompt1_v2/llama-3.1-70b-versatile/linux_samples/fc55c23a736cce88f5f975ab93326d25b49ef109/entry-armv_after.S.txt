VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 33-36, 48-51
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to branch history injection (BHI) attacks due to the use of speculative execution in the branch history injection mitigations.

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to mitigate branch history injection (BHI) attacks by using custom mitigation instructions. However, these mitigations themselves may contain vulnerabilities. In this specific case, the mitigations involve executing a loop of instructions that update the branch history, which may be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious branches. Furthermore, the .L__vectors_bhb_loop8_start and .L__vectors_bhb_bpiall_start labels are used to load the program counter with a hardcoded offset, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Specifically, lines 33-36 and 48-51 use the 'mov' instruction to load the program counter with a hardcoded offset, and lines 33-36 and 48-51 'W(ldr) pc, .L__vectors_bhb_loop8_start + 0x1004' and 'W(ldr) pc, .L__vectors_bhb_bpiall_start + 0x1008' instructions, respectively. If an attacker can influence the branch history, they can potentially execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, lines 33-36 and 48-51 do not include proper bounds checking or data validation on the loaded address, which allows for potential arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, you could consider implementing additional checks and validation on the loaded address to ensure it points to a trusted location in memory. You may also want to consider using a more secure method for updating the branch history, such as using a software-based random number generator to mitigate branch history injection.

Additionally, you should also ensure that all sensitive data is properly cleared and sanitized before use and that no unnecessary access to sensitive data is made.
