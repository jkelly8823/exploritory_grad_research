VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential data exposure through memory dumps.
EXPLANATION:
The identified vulnerability is present in the code because of the use of ARM-specific instructions `stmia` and `strmdb`. The `stmia` instruction stores the contents of registers onto the stack, while the `strmdb` instruction stores the contents of registers onto memory, including the `sp` register which holds the stack pointer.

The function calls for `vector_swi` and its variants have `strmdb` with the `lr (link register)` being written, but not its actual content or meaning within the scope of the register. Writing such register content directly in memory could potentially aid reverse engineering analysis on sensitive devices, if enough corresponding context can be matched against the retrieved file memory.

EXPLANATION Continued:
This could potentially lead to data exposure if the contents of the registers contain sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The registers used should be explicitly sanitized before being saved, depending on the requirements and scope of the procedure that will be called upon by this exception handler.

Alternatively, define an interrupt save area (ISA) for the save registers state within the stack area so that an analysis on the dumped registers might not reflect a significant breakdown that cannot be misinterpreted or directly serve significant malicious intent. In a different solution-oriented approach, perform the dump handling logic in secure memory that is typically resistant to crashes during system interruption.

Finally, set up a runtime protection flag for the dump areas after every write operation on the given area.
