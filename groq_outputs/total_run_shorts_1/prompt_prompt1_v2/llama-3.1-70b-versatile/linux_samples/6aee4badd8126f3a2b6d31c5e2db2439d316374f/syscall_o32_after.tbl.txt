VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I was unable to find any potential vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a section of a system call table, mapping system call numbers to their respective function names.

This code snippet does not perform any insecure operations, such as buffer copying, data parsing, or error handling, that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. The code is simply a mapping of system call numbers to function names, which is not inherently vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
