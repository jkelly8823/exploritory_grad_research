VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No known vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of system call mapping for x64 and x32 architectures in a Linux kernel. It simply defines the mapping of system call numbers to their respective handlers. There is no dynamic execution of user input, no memory access operations, and no arithmetic that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
433	common	fspick			__x64_sys_fspick
434	common	pidfd_open		__x64_sys_pidfd_open
435	common	clone3			__x64_sys_clone3/ptregs
437	common	openat2			__x64_sys_openat2

#
# x32-specific system call numbers start at 512 to avoid cache impact
# for native 64-bit operation. The __x32_compat_sys stubs are created
