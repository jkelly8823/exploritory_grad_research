VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be an excerpt from a Linux kernel header defining system calls. The code defines several system calls using a macro `__SYSCALL`, which takes two arguments: the system call number and the corresponding function. The defined system calls include `sys_pidfd_open`, `sys_clone3`, and `sys_openat2`. There is no identifiable vulnerability in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
__SYSCALL(__NR_pidfd_open, sys_pidfd_open)
#define __NR_clone3 435
__SYSCALL(__NR_clone3, sys_clone3)
#define __NR_openat2 437
__SYSCALL(__NR_openat2, sys_openat2)
