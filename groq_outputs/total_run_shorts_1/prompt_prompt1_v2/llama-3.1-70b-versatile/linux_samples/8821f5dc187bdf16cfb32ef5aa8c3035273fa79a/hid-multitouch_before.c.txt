VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 35
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Infinite loop vulnerability due to missing break statement and function parameter passing without validation.

EXPLANATION:
Upon analyzing the code snippet, a switch statement with multiple cases is observed. However, there is a case label without a corresponding break statement which leads to unreachable code and infinite loop issues. Further on line 35 'mt_store_field' function is being called without input validation which leads to a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
A 'break' statement should be introduced for the 'HID_DG_CONTACTMAX:' case to prevent execution flow to pass into the default sequence or the subsequent case that belongs to the prior case label. Furthermore, validate function input parameters to prevent any possible vulnerabilities. The 'mt_store_field' function parameter validation is recommended.

Additionally, an 'assert()' or a 'defaults' case is expected in every switch block to catch unexpected cases. It is also recommended to define switch case values and labels within an enumerated type.

ORIGINAL CODE:

__s8 inputmode_index;	/* InputMode HID feature index in the report */
__s8 maxcontact_report_id;	/* Maximum Contact Number HID feature,
				   -1 if non-existent */
__u8 num_received;	/* how many contacts we received */
__u8 num_expected;	/* expected last contact index */
__u8 maxcontacts;
