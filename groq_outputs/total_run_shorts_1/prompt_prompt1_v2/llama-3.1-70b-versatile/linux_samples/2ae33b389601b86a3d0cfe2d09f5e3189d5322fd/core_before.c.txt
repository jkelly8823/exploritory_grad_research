VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unsecured usage of user-space input with potential for time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability and string comparison vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks the list of registered RNGs for a name clash. However, the input for the comparison comes from user-space (`rng->name`) and the code does not validate or sanitize this input properly before passing it to `strcmp()`, which can lead to undefined behavior if the input is a null-terminated string that has undergone manipulation. Additionally, the state of `tmp->name` is not synchronized, thus enabling TOCTOU vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input `rng->name` before passing it to `strcmp()`. This can be achieved by checking if the input string is a null-terminated string and ensuring that it does not exceed the maximum allowed length for a string.
2. Use `strscmp()` from `linux/string.c` library instead of `strcmp()` to mitigate string comparison vulnerabilities, as `strscmp()` has built-in security features to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using `mutex_lock()` before accessing `rng_list` to prevent TOCTOU vulnerabilities.
4. Validate that the `tmp->name` string pointer is valid before passing it to `strcmp()`.
