VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a driver for the ADS7846 touchscreen controller. It contains two functions: `__ads7846_enable` and `ads7846_disable`. Upon examining the code, I did not find any obvious vulnerabilities. Both functions seem to be accessing the `struct ads7846` members safely, and there are no apparent issues with data validation, memory management, or resource handling within the snippet.

However, it is worth noting that this is a relatively simple code snippet, and vulnerabilities might exist in other parts of the codebase that interact with these functions. Additionally, the provided snippet lacks variable declarations, function definitions, and other essential components that could impact the security analysis.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
/* Must be called with ts->lock held */

{
	regulator_enable(ts->reg);
	ads7846_restart(ts);
}

static void ads7846_disable(struct ads7846 *ts)
