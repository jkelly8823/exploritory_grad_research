VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any identifiable vulnerabilities. 

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a conditional compilation directive, with different definitions based on the configuration flags `CONFIG_CPU_HAS_ASID` and `CONFIG_MMU`. It checks for the presence of certain CPU features and sets up function declarations or definitions accordingly. Since it's largely conditional compilation directives and function declarations, we cannot identify any security vulnerabilities within the provided code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#ifdef CONFIG_CPU_HAS_ASID
void check_and_switch_context(struct mm_struct *mm, struct task_struct *tsk);
#define init_new_context(tsk,mm)	({ atomic64_set(&mm->context.id, 0); 0; })
#else	/* !CONFIG_CPU_HAS_ASID */
#ifdef CONFIG_MMU
