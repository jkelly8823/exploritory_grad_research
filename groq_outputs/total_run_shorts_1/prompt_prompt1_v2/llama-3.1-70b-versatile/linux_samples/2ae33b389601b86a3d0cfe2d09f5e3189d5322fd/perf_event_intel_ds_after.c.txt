VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No high-risk vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any obvious high-risk vulnerabilities. It appears to be a function for restoring the debug store in a CPU's performance monitoring unit. The function checks for certain PMU flags and then writes a value to a specific MSR (Model-Specific Register) if the conditions are met. The code is relatively simple and does not contain any clear issues with data validation, potential buffer overflows, or other common vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are provided for this code snippet, as it does not appear to contain any high-risk vulnerabilities.
ORIGINAL CODE:

```
            }
    }
}

void perf_restore_debug_store(void)
{
    struct debug_store *ds = __this_cpu_read(cpu_hw_events.ds);

    if (!x86_pmu.bts && !x86_pmu.pebs)
        return;

    wrmsrl(MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, (unsigned long)ds);
}
