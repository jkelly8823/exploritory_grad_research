VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a small, isolated function from a larger system. The function __tlb_flush_mm takes a pointer to an mm_struct as an argument, checks if the cpumask for the mm is empty, and if not, it potentially performs a TLB flush for the given mm on all CPUs. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the given code snippet. The code is simple and does not involve any user-controlled inputs, and there are no obvious memory or pointer manipulation issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:

static inline void __tlb_flush_mm(struct mm_struct * mm)
{
	if (unlikely(cpumask_empty(mm_cpumask(mm))))
		return;
	/*
	 * If the machine has IDTE we prefer to do a per mm flush
	 * on all cpus instead of doing a local flush if the mm
	 * only ran on the local cpu.
