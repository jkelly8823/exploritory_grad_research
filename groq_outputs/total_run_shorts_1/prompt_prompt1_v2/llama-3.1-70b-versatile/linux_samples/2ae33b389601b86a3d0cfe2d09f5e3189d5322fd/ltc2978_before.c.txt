VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Use-After-Free vulnerability due to function ltc2978_clear_peaks being called with device id before checking the return values of other function calls.
The use-after-free error appears when a program continues to use memory (usually on the heap) after it has been freed or deleted.

Additionally, an out-of-bounds access in function call vout_min[page] (see the PMBUS_VIRT_RESET_VOUT_HISTORY case), same can happen with temp2_max[page].
The potential exists because there isn't any validation check for page within these array on whether it's exceeding array size or not.


EXPLANATION:
Although the above cases don't exactly point towards the issue always, in cases where return values aren't checked, these pointer assignments and accesses might be invalid when the return values signify an error.

Another case can be argued for ltc2978_clear_peaks, as device id "page" can go beyond array indices defined for different data structures here like data->vout_min[page], data->temp2_max[page] if any integer value casted with PMBUS enum out of range is used as index with page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement  strict error checking on return values for file read operations before updating structures and issuing further calls with this structure.
Implement the proper bounds checking and validation for any indices (like page for given cases or id) for assigned value within arrays defined.
