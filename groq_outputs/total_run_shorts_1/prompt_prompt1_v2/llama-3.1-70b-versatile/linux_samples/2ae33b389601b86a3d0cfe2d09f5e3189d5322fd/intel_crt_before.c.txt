VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a function modifying the contents of a graphics card register. It is a bit manipulation routine that sets certain flags of the `crt->adpa_reg` register to disabled state.

This code snippet seems to be handling a very specific task of graphics card register configuration. Upon analysis, it does not exhibit any typical characteristics or patterns of common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, SQL injections, or path traversal attacks.

I have not found any known or potential security vulnerabilities within this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
	u32 temp;

	temp = I915_READ(crt->adpa_reg);
	temp &= ~(ADPA_HSYNC_CNTL_DISABLE | ADPA_VSYNC_CNTL_DISABLE);
	temp &= ~ADPA_DAC_ENABLE;
	I915_WRITE(crt->adpa_reg, temp);
}
