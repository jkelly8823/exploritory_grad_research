VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No detected vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of a device driver or low-level system code. It involves defining a set of clock duplicates and a table of OF (OpenFirmware) device IDs. The code is well-structured, and there are no obvious security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommended fixes are necessary for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE(usbd,   "tegra-ehci.0", NULL),
TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE(usbd,   "tegra-otg",    NULL),
TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE(cclk,   NULL,           "cpu"),
TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE(clk_max, NULL, NULL), /* Must be the last entry */
};
