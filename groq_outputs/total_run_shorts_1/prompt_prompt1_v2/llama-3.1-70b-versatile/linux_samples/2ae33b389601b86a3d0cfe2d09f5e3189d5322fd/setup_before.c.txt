VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a segment of low-level system code written in C, specifically for x86 architecture. It defines two structs for CPU information and an unsigned integer variable. The code seems to be initializing and exporting symbols for use elsewhere in the system.

The provided code does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or other potential security risks. However, it is essential to consider the context of this code within the larger project and ensure that it is not used in a way that might introduce vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is still essential to consider best practices for secure coding, such as proper error handling and memory management, when reviewing the code in the context of the larger project.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
/* cpu data as detected by the assembly code in head.S */
struct cpuinfo_x86 new_cpu_data __cpuinitdata = {0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, -1};
/* common cpu data for all cpus */
struct cpuinfo_x86 boot_cpu_data __read_mostly = {0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, -1};
EXPORT_SYMBOL(boot_cpu_data);

unsigned int def_to_bigsmp;
