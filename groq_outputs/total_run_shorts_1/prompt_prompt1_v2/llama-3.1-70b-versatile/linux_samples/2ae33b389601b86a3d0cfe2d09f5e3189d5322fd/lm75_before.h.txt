VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet does not appear to introduce any vulnerabilities. It includes a header file from the Linux kernel and defines two constants that represent the minimum and maximum temperature values for the LM75 temperature sensor. The constants are defined using the `#define` preprocessor directive, which does not execute code or have any potential for vulnerabilities. The code does not introduce any dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, or other operations that could potentially lead to security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
