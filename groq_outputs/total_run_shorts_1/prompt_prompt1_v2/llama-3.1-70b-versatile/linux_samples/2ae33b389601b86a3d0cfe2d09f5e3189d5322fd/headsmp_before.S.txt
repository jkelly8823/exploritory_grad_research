VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A write to a location based on an untrusted source.
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability is caused by a write to a memory location based on the value stored in `r0`, which is in turn derived from the value stored at `phys_l2x0_saved_regs`. This `phys_l2x0_saved_regs` seems to contain memory locations of saved registers and is used as a base address to load and store other register values. It is declared as a global variable, which could allow for modifications from other parts of the code. 
However, these modifications aren't checked to be within specific boundaries or range before being directly used as memory locations. Thus, if `phys_l2x0_saved_regs` were to be tampered with or contain garbage values, the program could write to arbitrary areas of memory.
 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Restrict access to `phys_l2x0_saved_regs` by making it non-modifiable (e.g., declaring it as `const` if it doesn't need to be changed), or ensuring that any modifications are thoroughly validated and sanitized.
- Validate the value stored at `phys_l2x0_saved_regs` before using it as a base address. 
- Verify the values of `r0`, `r1` and `r2` are in the desired range before performing operations using these registers.

 * The following code is located into the .data section.  This is to
 * allow phys_l2x0_saved_regs to be accessed with a relative load
 * as we are running on physical address here.
