VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities. It consists of EXPORT_SYMBOL macros which are used to make symbols (in this case, functions or variables) available for use by other kernel modules. This is a typical pattern in Linux kernel code. Since no user input, memory allocation, or other potentially vulnerable operations are present in this snippet, no vulnerability can be detected.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as there are no vulnerabilities detected in the code.
ORIGINAL CODE:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(__clear_user);

	/* bitops */
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
EXPORT_SYMBOL(__atomic_hash);
#endif

	/* physical memory */
EXPORT_SYMBOL(memstart_addr);
