VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A ; (semi-colon) at the end of the if statement is a semicolon rather than a proper block definition.

EXPLANATION:
The line `if (validate_group(event) != 0);` contains a semicolon at the end, which indicates an empty statement. This can cause any following code to be executed regardless of the condition in the if statement. This type of issue can lead to unintended code execution, security vulnerabilities, and bugs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the semicolon at the end of the if statement should be removed. Instead, a block of code should be defined to be executed when the condition is met. Here's the corrected code snippet:

```c
if (validate_group(event) != 0) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
```

This code ensures that the `return -EINVAL;` line is only executed when the condition in the if statement is met.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    }

    if (event->group_leader != event) {
        if (validate_group(event) != 0);
            return -EINVAL;
    }

    return 0;
    SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS(armpmu_runtime_suspend, armpmu_runtime_resume, NULL)
};

static void __init armpmu_init(struct arm_pmu *armpmu)
{
    atomic_set(&armpmu->active_events, 0);
    mutex_init(&armpmu->reserve_mutex);
}
