VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential out-of-bounds read due to lack of validation on port value used in I915_READ and I915_READ port register access.

EXPLANATION: 
In lines 6-8, the code uses `I915_READ(DP_TP_CTL(port))` and `I915_READ(DDI_BUF_CTL(port))` to read from port registers, but it does not validate the value of `port` before using it. This could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read if `port` is not a valid port number. However, there is no explicit indication of a bug here and often requires context, further port validation has been a common problem historically on similar I915 hardware projects.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the value of `port` before using it in the `I915_READ` macro. The minimum validation could involve ensuring that `port` is within a valid range of port numbers. However, this range might depend on specific hardware, so we recommend you also follow up with that hardware team validating it.

In addition, a comment or an explicit error handling mechanism can be added to line 6-8 to make this section's purpose and error handling clearer.

Please see code reorganization below.

ORIGINAL CODE:
(struct intel_dp *intel_dp = &intel_dig_port->dp;
struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv = encoder->dev->dev_private;
enum port port = intel_dig_port->port;
uint32_t val;
bool wait = false;

  if (I915_READ(DP_TP_CTL(port)) & DP_TP_CTL_ENABLE) {
      val = I915_READ(DDI_BUF_CTL(port));
      if (val & DDI_BUF_CTL_ENABLE) {
)

I recommend looking for array bounds and/or edge cases with port inputs when using similar system calls and validating them as required by their spec or API details.
