VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This segment of code appears to be a snippet of C or C++ code that defines several constants. Upon reviewing the code, no potential vulnerabilities were found. The code is simply defining constants and checking if the compilation mode is an assembly language, which is not a common source of vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations or fixes are necessary. However, it is always good practice to properly comment and document such code for better readability.
