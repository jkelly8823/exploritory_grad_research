VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The supplied code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the calculation of nr_pages.

EXPLANATION:
The calculation of nr_pages uses a shift operation on the pool->size, which can lead to an integer overflow if the pool size is large enough. This could result in an incorrect value being assigned to nr_pages. This can cause the for loop that immediately follows to iterate incorrectly, leading to a potential out-of-bounds access or an infinite loop.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent the integer overflow, consider using a larger data type for nr_pages or adding checks to prevent the overflow. For example, you can change the type of nr_pages to a larger type, such as long long. Additionally, consider adding checks to ensure that pool->size is a valid value before performing the calculation. 

Here's an example of how the code can be modified:

```c
unsigned long long nr_pages = (pool->size + PAGE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
```

This modification will prevent the integer overflow by first adding PAGE_SIZE - 1 to the pool size and then shifting. This way, the calculation is guaranteed to produce the correct result.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
{
	struct dma_pool *pool = &atomic_pool;
	pgprot_t prot = pgprot_dmacoherent(pgprot_kernel);
	unsigned long nr_pages = pool->size >> PAGE_SHIFT;
	unsigned long *bitmap;
	struct page *page;
	struct page **pages;
		ptr = __alloc_from_contiguous(NULL, pool->size, prot, &page,
					      atomic_pool_init);
	else
		ptr = __alloc_remap_buffer(NULL, pool->size, GFP_KERNEL, prot,
					   &page, atomic_pool_init);
	if (ptr) {
		int i;

		for (i = 0; i < nr_pages; i++)
```
