VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow in ABS_MT_POSITION_X/Y Resolution Setting

EXPLANATION:
In the mxt_initialize function, the input_abs_set_res function is used to set the resolution of the ABS_MT_POSITION_X and ABS_MT_POSITION_Y axes. However, the MXT_PIXELS_PER_MM value (20) is multiplied by the max_x and max_y values, which could potentially lead to an integer overflow when setting the resolution of these axes. This could result in incorrect pressure values being reported by the driver.

In the mxt_initialize function, the following lines of code are setting the resolution of the ABS_MT_POSITION_X and ABS_MT_POSITION_Y axes:

input_abs_set_res(input_dev, ABS_MT_POSITION_X, MXT_PIXELS_PER_MM);
input_abs_set_res(input_dev, ABS_MT_POSITION_Y, MXT_PIXELS_PER_MM);

However, in the following lines, the resolution is not correctly set because MXT_PIXELS_PER_MM is multiplied by max_x and max_y which can result in integer overflow:

input_set_abs_params(input_dev, ABS_X, 0, data->max_x, 0, 0);
input_set_abs_params(input_dev, ABS_Y, 0, data->max_y, 0, 0);

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should check for potential integer overflows when setting the resolution of the ABS_MT_POSITION_X and ABS_MT_POSITION_Y axes.

It is recommended to use the `input_abs_set_res` function to set the resolution of these axes, as it is designed to handle the multiplication of the resolution value and the max_x/max_y values without overflowing.

You should also add checks to ensure that the max_x and max_y values are not too large, and handle the case where they are.
