VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No exploitation vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a definition of a struct for a file's statistics, similar to the `stat` struct in Unix systems. The code checks the endianness of the system using preprocessor directives and defines the struct accordingly. There are no obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use of deprecated functions, in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
As this code snippet does not contain any evident vulnerabilities, no recommendations are provided.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
long long	st_size;
unsigned long	st_blksize;

#if defined(__BYTE_ORDER) ? __BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN : defined(__BIG_ENDIAN)
	unsigned long	__pad4;		/* future possible st_blocks high bits */
	unsigned long	st_blocks;	/* Number 512-byte blocks allocated. */
#elif defined(__BYTE_ORDER) ? __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN : defined(__BIG_ENDIAN)
	unsigned long	st_blocks;	/* Number 512-byte blocks allocated. */
	unsigned long	__pad4;		/* future possible st_blocks high bits */
#else
#error no endian defined
```
