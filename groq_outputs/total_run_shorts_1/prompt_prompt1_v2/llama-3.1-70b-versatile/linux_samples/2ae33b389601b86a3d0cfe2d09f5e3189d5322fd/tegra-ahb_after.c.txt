VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a small portion of a larger codebase, likely from a Linux kernel module. It appears to be functionality related to power management and AHB (Advanced High-Performance Bus) handling on NVIDIA Tegra devices.

The functions and macros used are properly prefixed and seem to follow standard Linux kernel coding practices. There are no obvious signs of common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string issues, or unchecked function calls.

The variables and pointers used are properly checked against NULL, and the `dev_get_drvdata` function seems to be used correctly to retrieve the device's private data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
ORIGINAL CODE:

EXPORT_SYMBOL(tegra_ahb_enable_smmu);
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_PM
static int tegra_ahb_suspend(struct device *dev)
{
	int i;
	struct tegra_ahb *ahb = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
