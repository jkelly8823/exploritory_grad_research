VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not detect any potential vulnerabilities. The code appears to be simply performing bit operations and accessing struct members without any obvious security concerns. The operations performed do not appear to be interacting with user-input data or sensitive information in a way that would introduce potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return data & (1 << bit) ? 1 : 0;
}

static int ichx_gpio_check_available(struct gpio_chip *gpio, unsigned nr)
{
	return (ichx_priv.use_gpio & (1 << (nr / 32))) ? 0 : -ENXIO;
}

static int ichx_gpio_direction_input(struct gpio_chip *gpio, unsigned nr)
```
