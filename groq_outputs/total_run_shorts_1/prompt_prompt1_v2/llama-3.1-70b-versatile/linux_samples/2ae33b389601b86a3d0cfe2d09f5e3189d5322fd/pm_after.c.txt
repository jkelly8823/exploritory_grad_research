VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Error Handling Vulnerability in Critical Section
EXPLANATION:
The function `at91_pm_enter` contains an error label that handles a suspend operation failure, but resumes previously suspended interrupts before resuming GPIO operations. This could potentially introduce a race condition where an interrupt occurs while the GPIO operations are being resumed but the system is not yet fully awake. Additionally, this can lead to potential system instability and unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix is to resume GPIO operations before resuming interrupts. The corrected error handling should resemble the following code:

```c
error:
	at91_pinctrl_gpio_resume();
	else
		at91_gpio_resume();
	at91_irq_resume();
```

This ensures that the GPIO operations are resumed before interrupts, reducing the chance of introducing a race condition.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
static int at91_pm_enter(suspend_state_t state)
{
	if (of_have_populated_dt())
		at91_pinctrl_gpio_suspend();
	else
		at91_gpio_suspend();
	at91_irq_suspend();

	pr_debug("AT91: PM - wake mask %08x, pm state %d\n",
			/* remember all the always-wake irqs */
error:
	target_state = PM_SUSPEND_ON;
	at91_irq_resume();
	if (of_have_populated_dt())
		at91_pinctrl_gpio_resume();
	else
		at91_gpio_resume();
	return 0;
}
