VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a sequence of bit-wise operations on a register value (ADPA). It reads a value, performs some operations to set or clear specific bits, and then writes the result back to the register. There are no apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. 
However, without additional context, it's impossible to rule out the possibility of an attack via a different method (e.g. timing attacks), as we're not aware of the potential threats this code may face. Nonetheless, in our standard evaluation given this snippet and standard procedure, we classify the risk of this snippet to be relatively safe.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no recommendations for changes to this snippet. 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
    u32 temp;

    temp = I915_READ(crt->adpa_reg);
    temp |= ADPA_HSYNC_CNTL_DISABLE | ADPA_VSYNC_CNTL_DISABLE;
    temp &= ~ADPA_DAC_ENABLE;
    I915_WRITE(crt->adpa_reg, temp);
}
```
