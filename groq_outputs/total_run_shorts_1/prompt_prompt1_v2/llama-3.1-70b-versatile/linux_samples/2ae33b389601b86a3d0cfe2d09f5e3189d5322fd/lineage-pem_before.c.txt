VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be defining attribute groups for a Linux kernel device driver. It consists of two attribute groups, pem_input_group and pem_fan_group, each containing a set of attribute pointers. Upon examining the provided code snippet, I did not identify any issues that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or sensitive data exposure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
&sensor_dev_attr_in2_input.dev_attr.attr,
&sensor_dev_attr_curr1_input.dev_attr.attr,
&sensor_dev_attr_power1_input.dev_attr.attr,
};

static const struct attribute_group pem_input_group = {
    .attrs = pem_input_attributes,
    &sensor_dev_attr_fan1_input.dev_attr.attr,
    &sensor_dev_attr_fan2_input.dev_attr.attr,
    &sensor_dev_attr_fan3_input.dev_attr.attr,
};

static const struct attribute_group pem_fan_group = {
    .attrs = pem_fan_attributes,
};```
