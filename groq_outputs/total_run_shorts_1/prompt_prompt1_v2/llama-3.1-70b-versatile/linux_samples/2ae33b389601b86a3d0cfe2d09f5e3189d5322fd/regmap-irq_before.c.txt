VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Error Handling Vulnerability and Information Disclosure
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains a potential vulnerability related to error handling and information disclosure. The code checks if `ret` is less than 0, and if so, it logs an error message with the return value of a system call (`ret`) along with a descriptive error string. However, in some cases, printing the return value may not be suitable as it can potentially leak error codes or other internal state, providing an attacker with additional information that could be used for malicious purposes. Furthermore, not properly handling errors can lead to security issues. For instance, if an error occurs and `ret` has a negative value, but the code execution is just interrupted by returning `IRQ_NONE` without further handling of potential system resource leak or corruption, this might lead to unpredictable behavior of the system. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Instead of logging the return value directly, consider using a more descriptive error message that doesn't include sensitive information.
2. Properly handle errors to ensure that the system is in a consistent state. This could involve releasing resources, restoring previous states, or triggering additional error handling mechanisms.
3. Be mindful that returning `IRQ_NONE` in error cases might be inappropriate in some scenarios and reconsider the function's behavior.

ORIGINAL CODE:

		if (ret < 0) {
			dev_err(map->dev, "IRQ thread failed to resume: %d\n",
				ret);
			return IRQ_NONE;
		}
