VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential unhandled error in `alps_enter_command_mode` and related functions.
This code does not properly check the return values of several functions, potentially leading to errors being overlooked.
EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, `alps_enter_command_mode` is a function that seems to handle entering command mode for a PS/2 mouse. The function calls several other functions, such as `alps_rpt_cmd`, and checks their return values, but not all of these return values are properly checked in the calling functions.

For example, in `alps_set_defaults`, a return value from `alps_match_table` is checked, and a specific error code (0) is returned when the protocol version is V3. However, this return value is not checked consistently across all the calling functions.

Furthermore, the function `alps_enter_command_mode` itself has several error paths, but they all return -1. However, not all the calling functions properly check for this error code.

This inconsistent error checking can lead to errors being overlooked, which can have serious consequences.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Properly check the return values of all the functions called by `alps_enter_command_mode` and its related functions. Use specific error codes and handle them consistently in the code. Avoid simply returning -1 for all error cases, as this can make error diagnosis difficult.

Here is an example of how the error checking can be improved:

```c
static inline int alps_exit_command_mode(struct psmouse *psmouse)
{
    int ret = -EIO;

    if (alps_enter_command_mode(psmouse, NULL)) {
        psmouse_err(psmouse, "Failed to enter command mode\n");
        return ret;
    }

    // ... rest of the function
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


(Note: The vulnerable code snippet has many code blocks but the exact code lines start after a sequence.)

```c
if (alps_enter_command_mode(psmouse, NULL)) {
    return -1;
}

...

if (alps_enter_command_mode(psmouse, NULL)) {
    psmouse_err(psmouse, "Failed to enter command mode\n");
    goto error;
}

...

if (alps_enter_command_mode(psmouse, NULL) ||
    alps_absolute_mode_v3(psmouse)) {
    psmouse_err(psmouse, "Failed to enter absolute mode\n");
    goto error;
}

...

if (alps_enter_command_mode(psmouse, NULL) ||
    alps_command_mode_read_reg(psmouse, 0xc2d9) == -1 ||
    alps_command_mode_write_reg(psmouse, 0xc2cb, 0x00))
    goto error;

...

if (alps_match_table(psmouse, priv, e7, ec) == 0) {
    return 0;
} else if (ec[0] == 0x88 && ec[1] == 0x08) {
    priv->proto_version = ALPS_PROTO_V3;
    alps_set_defaults(priv);
}
