VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Magic number vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided uses magic numbers directly in the code. Magic numbers are numerical values that appear in code without clear explanation or definition of their purpose. The use of magic numbers (e.g., `0x0918`, `0x3fd4`, `0x08ac`, `0x100800`, `magicgpc918`) can make the code harder to understand and more difficult to maintain.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to replace magic numbers with named constants. Named constants provide clear and concise definitions for numerical values, making the code more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand. This can be achieved by defining an enumeration, a set of named constants, or even macro definitions at the top of the file or in a header file.

ORIGINAL CODE:

		nv_wr32(priv, GPC_UNIT(gpc, 0x0918), magicgpc918);
	}

	nv_wr32(priv, GPC_BCAST(0x3fd4), magicgpc918);
	nv_wr32(priv, GPC_BCAST(0x08ac), nv_rd32(priv, 0x100800));
}
