VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a collection of function declarations for various OMAP and AM35xx processor initialization functions. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code, such as buffer overflows, use of uninitialized variables, or format string vulnerabilities. The code also does not seem to perform any sensitive operations, such as memory allocation, file I/O, or network communication. The conditional definition based on the `CONFIG_SOC_OMAP2420` and `CONFIG_SOC_OMAP2430` preprocessor directives seems to be properly used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet, as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, as this code is part of a larger system, reviewing the implementation of these functions to ensure proper error handling and input validation would be recommended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
void omap3630_init_late(void);
void am35xx_init_late(void);
void ti81xx_init_late(void);
void omap4430_init_late(void);
int omap2_common_pm_late_init(void);

#if defined(CONFIG_SOC_OMAP2420) || defined(CONFIG_SOC_OMAP2430)
void omap2xxx_restart(char mode, const char *cmd);
```
