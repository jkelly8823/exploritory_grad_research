VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No known vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a segment of C code that defines functions and a struct for ATA ACPI functions. Upon reviewing the code, I did not identify any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, or sensitive data exposure. The functions and struct declared here appear to be benign and do not interact with user input or external data in a way that would raise security concerns.
RECOMMENDATIONS: No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	return -ENODEV;
}

static int ata_acpi_find_dummy(struct device *dev, acpi_handle *handle)
{
	return -ENODEV;
}

static struct acpi_bus_type ata_acpi_bus = {
	.find_bridge = ata_acpi_find_dummy,
	.find_device = ata_acpi_find_device,
};

int ata_acpi_register(void)
```
