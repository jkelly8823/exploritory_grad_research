VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, no obvious vulnerabilities were found. The code defines several static variables and initializes them with constant values. There are no indicators of potential buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of `const` and `__initconst` keywords suggests that the variables are properly defined and not subject to modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
