VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses pointer arguments in function calls without proper validation. Specifically, the `on_each_cpu` function call passes `NULL` as a pointer argument without checking if the receiver end can handle NULL values.

EXPLANATION:
In the `flush_tlb_all` and `flush_bp_all` functions, the `on_each_cpu` function is called with a NULL pointer as the second argument. Without the definition of `on_each_cpu`, it's difficult to know how it handles NULL values. However, in general, passing NULL pointers to function calls without proper validation can result in null pointer dereferences or unexpected behavior.

Furthermore, in `flush_tlb_all` function, the variables `start` and `end` are used without declaration. Although it's expected to be a hunk of a commit and we might not have access to the full code, using undefined variables can still introduce vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Verify that `on_each_cpu` can handle NULL values properly. If not, ensure that non-NULL valid pointers are passed to `on_each_cpu`.
* In the `flush_tlb_all` function, validate and verify that the variables `start` and `end` are defined and have the expected values before passing them to `local_flush_tlb_kernel_range`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
local_flush_tlb_kernel_range(ta->ta_start, ta->ta_end);
}

static inline void ipi_flush_bp_all(void *ignored)
{
	local_flush_bp_all();
}

void flush_tlb_all(void)
{
	if (tlb_ops_need_broadcast())
		on_each_cpu(ipi_flush_tlb_all, NULL, 1);
		local_flush_tlb_kernel_range(start, end);
}

void flush_bp_all(void)
{
	if (tlb_ops_need_broadcast())
		on_each_cpu(ipi_flush_bp_all, NULL, 1);
	else
		local_flush_bp_all();
}
