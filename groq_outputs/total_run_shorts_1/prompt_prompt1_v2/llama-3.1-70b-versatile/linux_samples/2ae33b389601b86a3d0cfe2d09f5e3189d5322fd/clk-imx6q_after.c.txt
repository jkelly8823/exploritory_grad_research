VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of a Linux kernel device driver, possibly for a Freescale i.MX6 processor. It defines a clock data structure and initializes an array of clock IDs. The code uses enum and struct data types to organize the clock data, which is a common and acceptable practice. There are no apparent buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or other common vulnerabilities that can be identified in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made to address vulnerabilities, as none were identified. However, it is essential to ensure that the code follows best practices for secure coding, such as input validation, bounds checking, and avoiding the use of insecure functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static struct clk_onecell_data clk_data;

static enum mx6q_clks const clks_init_on[] __initconst = {
	mmdc_ch0_axi, rom, pll1_sys,
};

static struct clk_div_table clk_enet_ref_table[] = {
	{ .val = 0, .div = 20, },
};
