VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability identified is the use of non-const magic numbers in the code. This makes the code harder to understand and maintain, and is generally considered a bad practice.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the numbers 0x61002c and 4 are used as literal values. These numbers seem to be specific addresses or bitmasks, but without further context, their meaning is unclear. Using literal numbers like this can make the code harder to understand, as their meaning is not explicitly stated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Define named constants for these numbers, as this will make the code more readable and easier to maintain. This can be done by defining a `#define` or an `enum` at the top of the file, and then using those constants in the code. For example:

```c
#define VBLANK_MASK_REGISTER 0x61002c
#define VBLANK_BIT_SHIFT 2
```

Then, in the code:

```c
static void
nv50_disp_base_vblank_enable(struct nouveau_event *event, int head)
{
	nv_mask(event->priv, VBLANK_MASK_REGISTER, (1 << VBLANK_BIT_SHIFT << head), (1 << VBLANK_BIT_SHIFT << head));
}

static void
nv50_disp_base_vblank_disable(struct nouveau_event *event, int head)
{
	nv_mask(event->priv, VBLANK_MASK_REGISTER, (1 << VBLANK_BIT_SHIFT << head), 0);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static void
nv50_disp_base_vblank_enable(struct nouveau_event *event, int head)
{
	nv_mask(event->priv, 0x61002c, (4 << head), (4 << head));
}

static void
nv50_disp_base_vblank_disable(struct nouveau_event *event, int head)
{
	nv_mask(event->priv, 0x61002c, (4 << head), 0);
}

static int
nv50_disp_base_ctor(struct nouveau_object *parent,
```
