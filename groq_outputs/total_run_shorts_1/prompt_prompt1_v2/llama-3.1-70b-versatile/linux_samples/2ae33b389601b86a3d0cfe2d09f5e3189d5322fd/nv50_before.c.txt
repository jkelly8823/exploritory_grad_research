VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a graphics driver, specifically handling VBLANK enable and disable events for NVIDIA chips. The code snippet uses bitwise operations to modify a private structure (`event->priv`) and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or tainted input. The `nv_mask` function is used to set or clear specific bits in the `event->priv` structure, which appears to be a valid and safe operation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary, as none were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static void
nv50_disp_base_vblank_enable(struct nouveau_event *event, int head)
{
	nv_mask(event->priv, 0x61002c, (1 << head), (1 << head));
}

static void
nv50_disp_base_vblank_disable(struct nouveau_event *event, int head)
{
	nv_mask(event->priv, 0x61002c, (1 << head), (0 << head));
}
