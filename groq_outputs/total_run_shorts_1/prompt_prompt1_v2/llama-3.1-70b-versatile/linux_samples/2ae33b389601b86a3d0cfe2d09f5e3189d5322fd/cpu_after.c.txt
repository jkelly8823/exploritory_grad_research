VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a part of Linux kernel code responsible for restoring system state after an interrupt or an exception. The functions called within this snippet, such as `do_fpu_end()`, `mtrr_bp_restore()`, and `perf_restore_debug_store()`, are part of the Linux kernel's internal API and do not seem to be involved in any known security vulnerabilities.

However, it is essential to note that this snippet is incomplete, and a more thorough analysis of the surrounding code and call sites for these functions would be required to rule out any potential security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
