VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a portion of a kernel module for Linux, specifically related to the LM75 temperature sensor. It defines two constants for the minimum and maximum temperature values of the sensor. These definitions do not contain any potentially vulnerable code such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or tainted user input. As a result, no recommendations are needed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
which contains this code, we don't worry about the wasted space.

#include <linux/kernel.h>

/* straight from the datasheet */
#define LM75_TEMP_MIN (-55000)
#define LM75_TEMP_MAX 125000
