VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14, 23-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet presents a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. In the conditional blocks, the code performs writes to memory without checking the bounds of the buffer. Specifically, the code writes to memory locations at `[r0]`, `[r0, #4]`, and `[r0, #4]` again, with increments of 4 bytes. However, the code does not verify if the buffer has sufficient space to hold the data.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the absence of bounds checking when writing to memory. The code assumes that the buffer has sufficient space to hold the data, but this assumption may not always hold true. If the buffer is not large enough, the writes can overflow the buffer, potentially leading to data corruption or arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the code's use of absolute addresses and register-based addressing can make it difficult to track the memory locations being written to, further increasing the risk of buffer overflows.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement bounds checking: Verify that the buffer has sufficient space to hold the data before writing to it.
2. Use safer memory access functions: Consider using library functions that provide bounds checking and safer memory access, such as `memcpy` or `memset`.
3. Limit the size of writes: Restrict the size of writes to prevent buffer overflows.
