VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a function or method that checks if the CPU has certain features, specifically X86_FEATURE_MWAIT and X86_FEATURE_CLFLSH. The function exits early if these features are not present. There are no obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or unexpected input handling. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as no vulnerabilities have been identified.
ORIGINAL CODE:
	unsigned int eax, ebx, ecx, edx;
	unsigned int highest_cstate = 0;
	unsigned int highest_subcstate = 0;
	int i;
	void *mwait_ptr;
	struct cpuinfo_x86 *c = __this_cpu_ptr(&cpu_info);

	if (!this_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_MWAIT))
		return;
	if (!this_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_CLFLSH))
