VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the given code snippet, I was unable to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a portion of a function from a Linux kernel module that seems to be handling hardware restoration tasks, specifically related to the FPU (Floating-Point Unit), scheduler clock, and Memory Type Range Register (MTRR). However, without more context about how the functions are declared and used, and given that there are no obvious issues such as buffer overflows, use of potentially vulnerable functions (e.g. strcpy), or improper error handling, I could not identify any vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <linux/suspend.h>
#include <linux/export.h>
#include <linux/smp.h>

#include <asm/pgtable.h>
#include <asm/proto.h>
#include <asm/mtrr.h>
	do_fpu_end();
	x86_platform.restore_sched_clock_state();
	mtrr_bp_restore();
}

/* Needed by apm.c */
void restore_processor_state(void)
