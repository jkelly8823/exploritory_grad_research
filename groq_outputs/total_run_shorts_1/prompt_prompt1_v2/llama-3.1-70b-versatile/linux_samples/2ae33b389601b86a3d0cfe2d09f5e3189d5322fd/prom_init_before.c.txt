VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet has potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `__reloc_toc` function. This function takes an array `toc_entry` and increments it without checking the bounds of the array. This could potentially lead to overwriting memory beyond the end of the array. The issue arises because `nr_entries` is not checked to be within the bounds of the actual array size, leading to potential overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate `nr_entries` to ensure it does not exceed the actual size of the `toc_entry` array. 

The following code change can be done:

```c
for (i = 0; i < nr_entries && toc_entry < tocstart + offset + nr_entries * sizeof(long); i++) {
    *toc_entry = *toc_entry + offset;
    toc_entry++;
}
```

This change will ensure that the `toc_entry` does not exceed the bounds of the actual array.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
{
}
#else
static void __reloc_toc(void *tocstart, unsigned long offset,
			unsigned long nr_entries)
{
	unsigned long i;
	unsigned long *toc_entry = (unsigned long *)tocstart;

	for (i = 0; i < nr_entries; i++) {
		*toc_entry = *toc_entry + offset;
		toc_entry++;
	unsigned long nr_entries =
		(__prom_init_toc_end - __prom_init_toc_start) / sizeof(long);

	/* Need to add offset to get at __prom_init_toc_start */
	__reloc_toc(__prom_init_toc_start + offset, offset, nr_entries);

	mb();
}


	mb();

	/* __prom_init_toc_start has been relocated, no need to add offset */
	__reloc_toc(__prom_init_toc_start, -offset, nr_entries);
}
#endif
#endif
