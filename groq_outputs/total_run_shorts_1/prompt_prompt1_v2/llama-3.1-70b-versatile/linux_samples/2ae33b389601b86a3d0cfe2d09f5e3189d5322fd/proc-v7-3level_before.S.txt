VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a part of an ARM CPU context switch routine. It appears to be a low-level assembly code that deals with switching between different memory contexts. The code checks for the presence of a Memory Management Unit (MMU) and performs necessary actions to set up the correct page tables.

This code snippet is well-structured and follows proper conventions. The use of assembly instructions is not inherently vulnerable. However, it's essential to note that vulnerabilities in low-level code can often be caused by incorrect assumptions about the input data or internal state, but in this case, we don't have enough information to evaluate those factors.

Given the provided code, there are no apparent vulnerabilities that can be detected. The code performs necessary operations and does not handle any user-provided data directly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be provided for this code snippet since no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
