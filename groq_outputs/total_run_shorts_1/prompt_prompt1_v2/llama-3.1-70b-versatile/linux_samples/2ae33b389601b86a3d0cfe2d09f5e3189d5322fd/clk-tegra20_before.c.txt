VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel device tree file or a device driver. It defines clock duplicates and a table of device IDs for a Power Management Controller (PMC). Upon examination, I do not see any obvious security vulnerabilities or errors that could lead to compromise. This is likely due to the fact that this code snippet seems to be configuration data and does not contain any dynamic or user-controllable input, and all assignments appear to be straight-forward assignments, with no observed use-after-free, use of uninitialized memory or pointer arithmetic that could be exploited.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As this code snippet appears to be configuration data and does not contain any dynamic or user-controllable input, no recommendations for security fixes are warranted based on the presented snippet.
