1. Introduction
===============
Complex SoCs of today consists of a multiple sub-modules working in conjunction.
In an operational system executing varied use cases, not all modules in the SoC
need to function at their highest performing frequency all the time. To
facilitate this, sub-modules in a SoC are grouped into domains, allowing some
domains to run at lower voltage and frequency while other domains are loaded
more. The set of discrete tuples consisting of frequency and voltage pairs that
the device will support per domain are called Operating Performance Points or
OPPs.

OPP library provides a set of helper functions to organize and query the OPP
information. The library is located in drivers/base/power/opp.c and the header
is located in include/linux/opp.h. OPP library can be enabled by enabling
CONFIG_PM_OPP from power management menuconfig menu. OPP library depends on
