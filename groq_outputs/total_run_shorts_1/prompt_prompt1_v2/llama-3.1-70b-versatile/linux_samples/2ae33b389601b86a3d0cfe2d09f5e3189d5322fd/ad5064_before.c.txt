VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2 occurrences of lines near line 9 (mutex_lock) and subsequent occurrences.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Deadlocks due to non-atomic operations.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to deadlocks because it's not handling locking atomicity correctly. The `mutex_lock()` function is being called multiple times (line 9 and subsequent occurrences) within the same critical section without unlocking. This could potentially lead to a deadlock if another thread also tries to acquire the same lock.
For example, in the `case IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW` block, a lock is acquired before calling `ad5064_write()`. However, within `ad5064_write()`, a call is made to `ad5064_sync_powerdown_mode()` which also locks the mutex, potentially leading to a deadlock.

Additionally, the calls to `mutex_lock` and `mutex_unlock` seem to be missing a parameter. Assuming the mutex is declared elsewhere as `struct mutex` named `mlock`, the correct calls should be `mutex_lock(&mlock)` and `mutex_unlock(&mlock)`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use locking mechanisms that ensure atomicity of critical sections.
2. Fix the locking calls to include the correct mutex object.
3. Determine whether it's necessary to lock the mutex multiple times within a function or not, and restructure the code accordingly to avoid potential deadlocks.
