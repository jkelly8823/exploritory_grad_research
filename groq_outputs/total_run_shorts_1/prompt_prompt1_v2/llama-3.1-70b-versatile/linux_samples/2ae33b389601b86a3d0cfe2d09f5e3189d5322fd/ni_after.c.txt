VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a function that handles GPU reset mask processing. It checks for specific conditions and updates the reset mask accordingly. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as unvalidated user input, buffer overflows, or potential data type mismatches. It also does not perform any file operations, network communication, or execute system commands, which are common entry points for vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No fixes are recommended for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	if (tmp & L2_BUSY)
		reset_mask |= RADEON_RESET_VMC;

	/* Skip MC reset as it's mostly likely not hung, just busy */
	if (reset_mask & RADEON_RESET_MC) {
		DRM_DEBUG("MC busy: 0x%08X, clearing.\n", reset_mask);
		reset_mask &= ~RADEON_RESET_MC;
	}

	return reset_mask;
}
