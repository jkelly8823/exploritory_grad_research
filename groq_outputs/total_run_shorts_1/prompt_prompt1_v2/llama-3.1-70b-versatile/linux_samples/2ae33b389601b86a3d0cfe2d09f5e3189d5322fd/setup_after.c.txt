VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of code from a Linux kernel source file, specifically related to x86 CPU architecture. It contains struct definitions for `cpuinfo_x86` data, initializes two instances of this struct (`new_cpu_data` and `boot_cpu_data`), and exports one of these instances as a symbol. The code also defines a single unsigned integer variable `def_to_bigsmp`. After careful analysis, no obvious security vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

However, it's essential to note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger codebase, and vulnerabilities might exist in other components or in the interactions between this code and other parts of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
/* cpu data as detected by the assembly code in head.S */
struct cpuinfo_x86 new_cpu_data __cpuinitdata = {
	.wp_works_ok = -1,
	.fdiv_bug = -1,
};
/* common cpu data for all cpus */
struct cpuinfo_x86 boot_cpu_data __read_mostly = {
	.wp_works_ok = -1,
	.fdiv_bug = -1,
};
EXPORT_SYMBOL(boot_cpu_data);

unsigned int def_to_bigsmp;
```
