VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be written in C and consists of EXPORT_SYMBOL macros, which are used in Linux kernel development to export symbols (functions or variables) to be used by modules. 
No obvious vulnerabilities can be identified in this code snippet, as it lacks dynamic memory allocation, user input, and complex logic that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.
It's essential to note that the EXPORT_SYMBOL macro itself does not inherently introduce any vulnerabilities; it's a legitimate kernel development construct.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities can be provided, as no vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(__clear_user);

    /* bitops */
EXPORT_SYMBOL(__atomic_hash);

    /* physical memory */
EXPORT_SYMBOL(memstart_addr);
