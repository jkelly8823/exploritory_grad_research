VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer overflow vulnerability in for loop condition.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in the for loop condition. The loop iterates over the variable `nr_pages`, which is calculated by right-shifting the `pool->size` by `PAGE_SHIFT`. If `pool->size` is very large and the right-shift operation causes an underflow, the resulting value of `nr_pages` could be a small positive integer. However, in the for loop, `i` is declared as an `int`, and it may cause an integer overflow if `nr_pages` is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by `int`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to use a type that can handle the maximum value of `nr_pages`, such as `size_t` or `unsigned long`. Additionally, it's recommended to check for potential overflows before performing arithmetic operations.

Here is an example of how the for loop could be rewritten:
```c
for (size_t i = 0; i < nr_pages; i++) {
    // ...
}
```
Alternatively, you could also use a more robust method to calculate the loop bounds, such as using a `while` loop and manually incrementing the counter.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
    struct dma_pool *pool = &atomic_pool;
    pgprot_t prot = pgprot_dmacoherent(pgprot_kernel);
    gfp_t gfp = GFP_KERNEL | GFP_DMA;
    unsigned long nr_pages = pool->size >> PAGE_SHIFT;
    unsigned long *bitmap;
    struct page *page;
    struct page **pages;
    ptr = __alloc_from_contiguous(NULL, pool->size, prot, &page,
                              atomic_pool_init);
else
    ptr = __alloc_remap_buffer(NULL, pool->size, gfp, prot, &page,
                           atomic_pool_init);
if (ptr) {
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < nr_pages; i++)
```
