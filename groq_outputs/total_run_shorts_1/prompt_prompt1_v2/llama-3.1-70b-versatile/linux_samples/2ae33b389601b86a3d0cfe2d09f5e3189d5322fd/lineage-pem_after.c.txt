VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses NULL pointer constant at the end of attribute arrays which can lead to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the attribute arrays pem_input_attributes and pem_fan_attributes, the NULL pointer is used as a sentinel at the end. However, the structure attribute_group expects a pointer to an array of pointers as the .attrs field. There's also an initialization issue with the .attrs field in pem_input_group and pem_fan_group where it is trying to assign multiple addresses of attributes that doesn't match with the structure. However the NULL used as a terminator can cause an issue because the NULL value may be mistaken as a valid attribute pointer, which can result in accessing a dereferenced null pointer during iteration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Revise the initialization of pem_input_group to be consistent with its expected type.
- Wrap the termination address by the actual pointer termination rather than NULL.

	&sensor_dev_attr_fan2_input.dev_attr.attr,
	&sensor_dev_attr_fan3_input.dev_attr.attr,
	NULL

	.attrs = pem_fan_attributes,
