VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Static Variable Use in a Multithreaded Environment

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a static variable `is_done` in a function that appears to be a module notification handler. The use of static variables in a multithreaded environment can lead to issues with data consistency and integrity. Since the `acpi_processor_notify_smm` function can be called concurrently by multiple modules, the `is_done` variable may be accessed and modified simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following options:

1. Use a thread-safe data structure, such as a mutex-protected integer or an atomic variable, to ensure that the `is_done` flag is accessed and updated safely.
2. Remove the static variable and replace it with a non-static variable or a data structure that can be safely shared among multiple threads.
3. If the `is_done` flag is not intended to be shared among multiple threads, consider moving it to a non-static scope or using a per-thread storage.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	return result;
}

static int acpi_processor_get_performance_info(struct acpi_processor *pr)
{
	int result = 0;
	acpi_status status = AE_OK;
	acpi_handle handle = NULL;
#endif
	return result;
}

int acpi_processor_notify_smm(struct module *calling_module)
{
	acpi_status status;
	static int is_done = 0;
```
