VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability and missing bounds checking.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains two potential vulnerabilities. 

1. The loop counter `i` in the `for` loop (Line 7) is dependent on the input `nr_entries`, which is derived from a calculation involving undefined variables `__prom_init_toc_end` and `__prom_init_toc_start` (Line 12). Without knowledge of the actual values or constraints on these variables, it is unclear whether this will lead to a buffer overflow; however, the fact that bounds checking on `nr_entries` is not performed prior to the `for` loop iteration makes this code vulnerable.

2. Assuming that the loop iterates over the `toc_entry` pointer and modifies values, the statement `*toc_entry = *toc_entry + offset;` has the potential for undefined behavior if the resulting value would exceed the range that the `unsigned long` type can store.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these vulnerabilities, the following modifications are recommended:
- Ensure that `nr_entries` is not larger than the array size.
- Validate the incoming `nr_entries` and check for any constraints that may cause a buffer overflow.
- Include robust error handling mechanisms to handle potential exceptions.
- Evaluate the addition operation to ensure that the result would not exceed the range of `unsigned long`.
- Perform verification on the resulting address value after adding the offset, especially when indirect memory access is involved.


ORIGINAL CODE:
{
}
#else
static void __reloc_toc(unsigned long offset, unsigned long nr_entries)
{
	unsigned long i;
	unsigned long *toc_entry;

	/* Get the start of the TOC by using r2 directly. */
	asm volatile("addi %0,2,-0x8000" : "=b" (toc_entry));

	for (i = 0; i < nr_entries; i++) {
		*toc_entry = *toc_entry + offset;
		toc_entry++;
	unsigned long nr_entries =
		(__prom_init_toc_end - __prom_init_toc_start) / sizeof(long);

	__reloc_toc(offset, nr_entries);

	mb();
}


	mb();

	__reloc_toc(-offset, nr_entries);
}
