VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, no apparent vulnerabilities or issues were found. The code appears to be handling a GPU reset mask and making decisions based on its value. It checks for a display hang condition and clears an MC reset flag if it's set. The code does not contain any obvious security risks, such as unvalidated user input, out-of-bounds array access, or use of deprecated functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (r600_is_display_hung(rdev))
    reset_mask |= RADEON_RESET_DISPLAY;

    /* Skip MC reset as it's mostly likely not hung, just busy */
    if (reset_mask & RADEON_RESET_MC) {
        DRM_DEBUG("MC busy: 0x%08X, clearing.\n", reset_mask);
        reset_mask &= ~RADEON_RESET_MC;
    }

    return reset_mask;
}

static void r600_gpu_soft_reset(struct radeon_device *rdev, u32 reset_mask)
```
