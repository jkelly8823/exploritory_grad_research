VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is potentially vulnerable to an integer overflow when calculating the size for the reallocation of memory for `data->group.attrs`.

EXPLANATION:
The code multiplies `data->max_attributes` by the size of a pointer to a `struct attribute` and casts it to a different type (size_t). However, if `data->max_attributes` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a size_t when multiplied by the size of a pointer to a `struct attribute`, this will result in an integer overflow.

In this specific case, the multiplication operation itself is not performed on an integer overflow-prone type as `sizeof` operator results in a size_t. However, since this result will then be passed to `krealloc` function which expects a `size_t` as its second argument, the multiplication is effectively being performed on `data->max_attributes`, and then converted to a size_t.

This could result in an insufficient amount of memory being allocated, leading to potential buffer overflow when storing `attr` in `data->group.attrs`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider adding checks to prevent integer overflow when calculating the size for the reallocation of memory.

For example:
```c
size_t alloc_size = sizeof(struct attribute *) * (data->max_attributes + 1);
if (alloc_size < sizeof(struct attribute *))
{
    // handle integer overflow error
}
data->group.attrs = krealloc(data->group.attrs, alloc_size, GFP_KERNEL);
```
Alternatively, the vulnerable line could also be rewritten with explicit bounds-checking as follows:
```c
size_t current_alloc_size = sizeof(struct attribute *) * data->max_attributes;
if (current_alloc_size / sizeof(struct attribute *) != data->max_attributes)
{
    // handle integer overflow error
}
size_t next_alloc_size = current_alloc_size + sizeof(struct attribute *);
data->group.attrs = krealloc(data->group.attrs, next_alloc_size, GFP_KERNEL);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int pmbus_add_attribute(struct pmbus_data *data, struct attribute *attr)
{
    if (data->num_attributes >= data->max_attributes - 1) {
        data->max_attributes += PMBUS_ATTR_ALLOC_SIZE;
        data->group.attrs = krealloc(data->group.attrs,
                                     sizeof(struct attribute *) *
                                     data->max_attributes, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (data->group.attrs == NULL)
            return -ENOMEM;
    }

    data->group.attrs[data->num_attributes++] = attr;
    data->group.attrs[data->num_attributes] = NULL;
}
```
