VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a header file for s390 CPU architecture, defining constants for interrupt flags. The code is well-formed, and no obvious security vulnerabilities were identified. The constants are defined as bit shifts, which is a common and safe practice. There are no user-controlled inputs, pointer arithmetic, or other operations that could potentially introduce security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary, as the provided code snippet appears to be secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
#ifndef _ASM_S390_CPU_MF_H
#define _ASM_S390_CPU_MF_H

#include <asm/facility.h>

#define CPU_MF_INT_SF_IAE	(1 << 31)	/* invalid entry address */
#define CPU_MF_INT_SF_ISE	(1 << 30)	/* incorrect SDBT entry */
