ORIGINAL CODE:
```
I915_WRITE(GEN6_RC_SLEEP, 0);
I915_WRITE(GEN6_RC1e_THRESHOLD, 1000);
I915_WRITE(GEN6_RC6_THRESHOLD, 50000);
I915_WRITE(GEN6_RC6p_THRESHOLD, 150000);
I915_WRITE(GEN6_RC6pp_THRESHOLD, 64000); /* unused */

/* Check if we are enabling RC6 */
rc6_mode = intel_enable_rc6(dev_priv->dev);
