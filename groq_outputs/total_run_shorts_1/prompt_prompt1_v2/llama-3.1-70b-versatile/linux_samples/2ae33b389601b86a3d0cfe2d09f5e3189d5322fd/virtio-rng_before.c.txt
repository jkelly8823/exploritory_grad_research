VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to delayed cleanup in error-free execution path.

EXPLANATION:
Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, I noticed that in the error-free execution path, the cleanup operations `busy = false` and `vdev->config->del_vqs(vdev)` are executed after the function `virtrng_probe` returns `0` at Line 9. This indicates that these lines are unreachable and can cause resource leaks when an error does not occur. Additionally, the line `hwrng_unregister(&virtio_hwrng)` should also be executed in the error-free path to properly release any acquired resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Move the cleanup operations to before the `return 0` statement in the error-free path, ensuring that necessary resources are released regardless of whether an error occurs during execution. This will prevent potential resource leaks and ensure proper cleanup.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
	int err;

	/* We expect a single virtqueue. */
	vq = virtio_find_single_vq(vdev, random_recv_done, "input");
	if (IS_ERR(vq))
		return PTR_ERR(vq);

	err = hwrng_register(&virtio_hwrng);
	if (err) {
		vdev->config->del_vqs(vdev);
		return err;
	}

.busy = false;
	vdev->config->del_vqs(vdev);
	hwrng_unregister(&virtio_hwrng);
	return 0;
}
static int virtrng_probe(struct virtio_device *vdev)
{```
