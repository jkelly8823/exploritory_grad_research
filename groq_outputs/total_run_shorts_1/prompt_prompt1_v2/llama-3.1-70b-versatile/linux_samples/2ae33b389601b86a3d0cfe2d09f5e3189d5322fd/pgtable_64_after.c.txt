VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a preprocessor conditional directive for handling platform-specific configurations on PowerPC architectures with a 64-bit standard MMU. The primary purpose is to ensure that the TASK_SIZE_USER64 does not exceed the user VSID range. There are no overt vulnerabilities, such as user-controllable input, usage of insecure functions, or buffer overflows, present in this snippet. This section of code appears to be checking for valid conditions and behaving accordingly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. However, if this code is used to define security boundaries or limitations, it should be reviewed to ensure it meets the security requirements of the entire system and all edge cases are accounted for. The snippet itself seems to be valid, but its proper operation relies on the correct values of TASK_SIZE_USER64, ESID_BITS, and SID_SHIFT, which are not shown in the snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64
#if TASK_SIZE_USER64 > (1UL << (ESID_BITS + SID_SHIFT))
#error TASK_SIZE_USER64 exceeds user VSID range
#endif
#endif
