VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a low-level system initialization routine, specifically dealing with the Power Management (PM) and Level 2 cache (L2X0) configuration. The code uses ARM assembly macros to define a routine for resuming the L2 cache controller. While this code is low-level and deals with hardware-specific operations, there are no apparent vulnerabilities or security concerns in the provided snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are made, as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, it is essential to review the entire codebase and surrounding logic to ensure the security of the system. Additionally, following secure coding practices and performing regular code reviews can help identify potential vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#ifdef CONFIG_PM
/*
 * The following code must assume it is running from physical address
 * where absolute virtual addresses to the data section have to be
 * turned into relative ones.
