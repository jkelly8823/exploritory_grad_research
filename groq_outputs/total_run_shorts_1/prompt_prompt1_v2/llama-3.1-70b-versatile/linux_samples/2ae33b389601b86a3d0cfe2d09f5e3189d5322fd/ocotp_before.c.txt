VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet is minimal and only includes preprocessor directives and macro definitions. It does not contain any logical code that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities. The included header files and defined macros appear to be specific to the processor and hardware architecture. There is no apparent use of user input, memory management, or other common sources of vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Since no vulnerabilities were found, there are no recommended fixes.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <asm/processor.h>  /* for cpu_relax() */

#include <mach/mxs.h>

#define OCOTP_WORD_OFFSET     0x20
#define OCOTP_WORD_COUNT      0x20
