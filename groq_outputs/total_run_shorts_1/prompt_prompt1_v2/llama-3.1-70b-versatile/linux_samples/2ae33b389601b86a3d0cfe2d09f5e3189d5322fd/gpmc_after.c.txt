VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Resource leak due to exception not being properly handled.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not check if the clock `gpmc_l3_clk` was successfully enabled before attempting to disable and put it. If `clk_disable_unprepare` fails, the call to `clk_put` could still occur. This can cause a resource leak if `clk_disable_unprepare` fails because `clk_put` will decrement the reference count, potentially allowing the clock to be released prematurely. Additionally, if `clk_disable_unprepare` returns an error, it is not handled or propagated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should check the return value of `clk_disable_unprepare` to ensure that the clock has been properly disabled and unprepared before calling `clk_put`. Additionally, the return value of `clk_disable_unprepare` should be handled to prevent a resource leak in case of error.

Recommended fix:
```c
if (clk_disable_unprepare(gpmc_l3_clk)) {
    /* Handle the error or return it to the caller */
    dev_err(gpmc_dev, "Failed to disable and unprepare the clock");
    return rc;
}
clk_put(gpmc_l3_clk);
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
            /* TODO: remove, see function definition */
	gpmc_convert_ps_to_ns(gpmc_t);

	return 0;
}

#ifdef CONFIG_OF
	if (IS_ERR_VALUE(gpmc_setup_irq()))
		dev_warn(gpmc_dev, "gpmc_setup_irq failed\n");

	/* Now the GPMC is initialised, unreserve the chip-selects */
	gpmc_cs_map = 0;

	rc = gpmc_probe_dt(pdev);
	if (rc < 0) {
		clk_disable_unprepare(gpmc_l3_clk);
		clk_put(gpmc_l3_clk);
```
