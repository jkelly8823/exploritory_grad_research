Introduction
------------

Currently the ALPS touchpad driver supports four protocol versions in use by
ALPS touchpads, called versions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Information about the various
protocol versions is contained in the following sections.

Detection
---------

report" sequence: E8-E7-E7-E7-E9. The response is the model signature and is
matched against known models in the alps_model_data_array.

With protocol versions 3 and 4, the E7 report model signature is always
73-02-64. To differentiate between these versions, the response from the
"Enter Command Mode" sequence must be inspected as described below.

Command Mode
------------

using the same encoding used for addresses.

Packet Format
