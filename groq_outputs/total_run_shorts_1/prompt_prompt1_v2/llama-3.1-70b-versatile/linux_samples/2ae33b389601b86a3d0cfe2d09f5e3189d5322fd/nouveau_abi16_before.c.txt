VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a cleanup function for notifier state, iterating through a list of notifiers and calling `nouveau_abi16_ntfy_fini` for each one. The use of `list_for_each_entry_safe` suggests that the code is handling potential concurrent modifications to the list safely. There are no obvious signs of memory corruption, data exposure, or other vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None necessary. However, to ensure the code's correctness and robustness, it would be beneficial to verify the implementation of the `nouveau_abi16_ntfy_fini` function and ensure that it properly cleans up resources and handles any potential errors that may occur during the cleanup process.
ORIGINAL CODE:
{
	struct nouveau_abi16_ntfy *ntfy, *temp;

	/* cleanup notifier state */
	list_for_each_entry_safe(ntfy, temp, &chan->notifiers, head) {
		nouveau_abi16_ntfy_fini(chan, ntfy);
	}
}
