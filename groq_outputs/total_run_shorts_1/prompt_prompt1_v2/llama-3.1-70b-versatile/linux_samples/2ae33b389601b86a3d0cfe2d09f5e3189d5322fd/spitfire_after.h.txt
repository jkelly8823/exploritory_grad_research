VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a set of macro definitions for Sun4v chip types. There are no obvious vulnerabilities or potential security issues present in this code. The definitions seem to be simple numeric values assigned to preprocessor macros.

The `#ifndef __ASSEMBLY__` directive suggests that this code may be part of a larger file that contains assembly code, but the snippet itself does not contain any potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
