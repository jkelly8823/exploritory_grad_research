VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of Hardcoded Error Code (-EINVAL)
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the hardcoded error code `-EINVAL` for the `ext_pullup_enable_pin` field. This is a magic number that may not be clear to other developers or even to the same developer at a later point in time. Although `-EINVAL` is a well-known error code in Unix systems, its meaning should be explained or a constant defined to improve the code's readability and maintainability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using the hardcoded error code `-EINVAL`, consider defining a constant or using a documented constant from the relevant library or framework. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

An example of how to improve the code is to use a named constant or comment to explain what `-EINVAL` represents:
```c
#define RAUMFELD_ERROR_NO_EXT_PULLUP_PIN -EINVAL

// ...

.ext_pullup_enable_pin = RAUMFELD_ERROR_NO_EXT_PULLUP_PIN,
```
or
```c
// Invalid argument error code (-EINVAL)
.ext_pullup_enable_pin = -EINVAL,
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
.pin			= GPIO_ONE_WIRE,
.is_open_drain		= 0,
.enable_external_pullup	= w1_enable_external_pullup,
.ext_pullup_enable_pin	= -EINVAL,
};

struct platform_device raumfeld_w1_gpio_device = {
	.name	= "w1-gpio",
