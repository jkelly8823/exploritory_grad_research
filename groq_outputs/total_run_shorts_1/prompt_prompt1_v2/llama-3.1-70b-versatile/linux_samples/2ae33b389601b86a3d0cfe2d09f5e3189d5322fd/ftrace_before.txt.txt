VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inconsistent Error Handling - EINVAL not checked for all cases.

EXPLANATION:
Based on the provided state machine, it appears that this segment of code is implementing error handling for a status input. The inconsistency lies in the case where the status is 'not allocated' and the input is 0 ('do nothing'). In the 'allocated' case, the 'clear' operation is performed when the input is 'else', but in the 'not allocated' case, an error (EINVAL) is returned only when the input is 'else'. The error is not checked for when the input is 0 or 1. This inconsistent error handling may lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

However, as this is not actually a code snippet, but rather a state machine in a table, we can't pinpoint exact lines.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement consistent error handling across all status and input combinations. Add error checking for the 'not allocated' case when the input is 0 and 1. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

	status\input  |     0      |     1      |    else    |
	--------------+------------+------------+------------+
	not allocated |(do nothing)| alloc+swap |   EINVAL   |
	--------------+------------+------------+------------+
	allocated     |    free    |    swap    |   clear    |
	--------------+------------+------------+------------+
