VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No known vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of a Linux kernel code, specifically dealing with MMU context definitions. It uses preprocessor directives to conditionally compile code based on specific configuration options.

No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet. The use of `offsetof` function is safe and is commonly used to get the offset of a struct member from the start of the struct. There are no obvious buffer overflows, type mismatches, or other obvious vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, this code appears to be secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  BLANK();

#ifdef CONFIG_CPU_HAS_ASID
  DEFINE(MM_CONTEXT_ID,		offsetof(struct mm_struct, context.id.counter));
  BLANK();
#endif
  DEFINE(VMA_VM_MM,		offsetof(struct vm_area_struct, vm_mm));
  DEFINE(VMA_VM_FLAGS,		offsetof(struct vm_area_struct, vm_flags));
