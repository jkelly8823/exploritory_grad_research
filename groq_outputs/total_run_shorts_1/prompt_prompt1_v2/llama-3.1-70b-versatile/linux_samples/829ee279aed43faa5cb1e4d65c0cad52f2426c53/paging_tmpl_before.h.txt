VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Leak Through Unvalidated Pointer

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, the variable `table_gfn` is being passed to the function `gfn_to_gpa` without any validation or sanitization. This function call is then used to access memory at a specific address, which could potentially lead to information disclosure if the provided address is not within the expected bounds. 

Furthermore, this vulnerability is heightened due to the potential for a dangling pointer in the line marked as vulnerable, where `table_gfn` is translated to `gpa` and immediately dereferenced.

Additionally, the function `mmu->translate_gpa` also accepts a `gpa` which was derived from the `table_gfn` variable without any validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The following code modifications should be implemented:
- Validate the `table_gfn` value before passing it to `gfn_to_gpa`.
- Implement bounds checking for the address generated by `gfn_to_gpa` to prevent information disclosure.
- Consider dereferencing `table_gfn` before passing it to `gfn_to_gpa` to prevent any potential pointer aliasing.
 

ORIGINAL CODE:
			--walker->level;

			index = PT_INDEX(addr, walker->level);

			table_gfn = gpte_to_gfn(pte);
			offset    = index * sizeof(pt_element_t);
			pte_gpa   = gfn_to_gpa(table_gfn) + offset;
			walker->table_gfn[walker->level - 1] = table_gfn;
			walker->pte_gpa[walker->level - 1] = pte_gpa;

			real_gfn = mmu->translate_gpa(vcpu, gfn_to_gpa(table_gfn),
