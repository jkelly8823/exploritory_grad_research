VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a documentation or comment block describing two settings related to network connections, specifically Path MTU discovery and the choice of congestion control algorithm. It does not contain any executable code, and therefore, there is no possibility of a vulnerability in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
Path MTU discovery (MTU probing).  If MTU probing is enabled,
	this is the initial MSS used by the connection.

tcp_congestion_control - STRING
	Set the congestion control algorithm to be used for new
	connections. The algorithm "reno" is always available, but
	additional choices may be available based on kernel configuration.
