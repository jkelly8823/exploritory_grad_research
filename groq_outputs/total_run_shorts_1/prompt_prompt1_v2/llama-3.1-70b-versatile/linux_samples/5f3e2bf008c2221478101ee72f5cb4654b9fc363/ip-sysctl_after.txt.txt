VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a documentation comment describing the configuration options for a network protocol, specifically TCP connections and MTU probing. There are no executable code blocks or potential vulnerability-introducing operations present in this snippet. The provided information is purely descriptive and does not contain any actual code that could pose a security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, there are no recommended fixes.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
Path MTU discovery (MTU probing).  If MTU probing is enabled,
	this is the initial MSS used by the connection.

tcp_min_snd_mss - INTEGER
	TCP SYN and SYNACK messages usually advertise an ADVMSS option,
	as described in RFC 1122 and RFC 6691.
	If this ADVMSS option is smaller than tcp_min_snd_mss,
	it is silently capped to tcp_min_snd_mss.

	Default : 48 (at least 8 bytes of payload per segment)

tcp_congestion_control - STRING
	Set the congestion control algorithm to be used for new
	connections. The algorithm "reno" is always available, but
	additional choices may be available based on kernel configuration.
