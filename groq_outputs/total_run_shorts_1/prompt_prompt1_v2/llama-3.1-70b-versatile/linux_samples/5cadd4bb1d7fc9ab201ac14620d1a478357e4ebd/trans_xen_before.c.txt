VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-after-free vulnerability in memory deallocation.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calls `free_pages` or `free_page` functions on memory pointers, which appear to be used afterwards within the same function. The specific lines vulnerable are `gnttab_end_foreign_access(ring->intf->ref[i], 0, 0);` which frees the memory for the `ring->intf` pages and is then immediately used on `free_pages((unsigned long)bytes, ring->intf->ring_order - (PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT));`. Similarly, `free_page((unsigned long)ring->intf);` is called and then used `gnttab_end_foreign_access(ring->ref, 0, 0);`

Furthermore, on successful allocation call of `bytes` in line `bytes = (void *)__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO, order - (PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT));`,  `free_pages((unsigned long)bytes, ring->intf->ring_order - (PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT));` is immediately called if bytes is valid. Here the line could potentially create a use-after-free vulnerability.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Reorder memory deallocation calls, ensuring that pointer usage occurs before deallocation calls. Ensure that usage of pointer after deallocation is validated and corrected. Also, when allocating memory for `bytes`, it's not necessary to call `free_pages` immediately; instead, handle failure scenarios to free memory before the return statement.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
ref = priv->rings[i].intf->ref[j];
gnttab_end_foreign_access(ref, 0, 0);
}
free_pages((unsigned long)priv->rings[i].data.in,
priv->rings[i].intf->ring_order -
(PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT));
}
gnttab_end_foreign_access(priv->rings[i].ref, 0, 0);
free_page((unsigned long)priv->rings[i].intf);
}
if (ret < 0)
goto out;
ring->ref = ret;
bytes = (void *)__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO,
order - (PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT));
if (!bytes) {
ret = -ENOMEM;
goto out;
}
if (bytes) {
for (i--; i >= 0; i--)
gnttab_end_foreign_access(ring->intf->ref[i], 0, 0);
free_pages((unsigned long)bytes,
ring->intf->ring_order -
(PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT));
}
gnttab_end_foreign_access(ring->ref, 0, 0);
free_page((unsigned long)ring->intf);
return ret;
```
