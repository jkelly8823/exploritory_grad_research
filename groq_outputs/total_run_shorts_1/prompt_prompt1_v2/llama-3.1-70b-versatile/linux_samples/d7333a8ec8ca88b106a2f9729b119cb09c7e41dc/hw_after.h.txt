VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a header file (indicated by `_H` in the name) that defines several structs and declares some functions and variables related to wireless network device management. 
Since this code does not contain any dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, input validation, or other potentially vulnerable operations, it is safe to conclude that no vulnerabilities are present in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet, as it does not contain any vulnerabilities. 
However, in a real-world context, careful review of all the code that includes this header file would be crucial to determine if vulnerabilities could exist when it's being used.
