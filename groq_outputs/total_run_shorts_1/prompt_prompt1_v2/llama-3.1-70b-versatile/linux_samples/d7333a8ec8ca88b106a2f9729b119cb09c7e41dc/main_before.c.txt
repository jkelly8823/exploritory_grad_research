VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unchecked mutex lock results in a potential double free or use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents a potential double free or use-after-free vulnerability. In the function `wcn36xx_cancel_hw_scan`, a mutex `wcn->scan_lock` is locked twice consecutively without being unlocked in between. This can cause undefined behavior and potentially lead to a double free or use-after-free vulnerability.

In the code, `mutex_lock(&wcn->scan_lock);` is followed by another lock without an accompanying unlock. Furthermore, the following if statement `if (wcn->scan_req)` is followed by `mutex_unlock(&wcn->scan_lock);`, without executing any code that could potentially make `wcn->scan_req` true in this context. However, assuming that path may be executed elsewhere, the issue remains.

Additionally, the use of multiple mutexes (`wcn->conf_mutex`, `wcn->hal_mutex`, `wcn->scan_lock`) without proper synchronization and corresponding unlocks may introduce additional complexity and opportunities for deadlocks or use-after-free vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that mutex locks are paired with corresponding unlocks to prevent deadlock or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
2. Avoid nesting mutex locks without proper synchronization and corresponding unlocks.
3. Review the use of multiple mutexes and ensure that they are properly synchronized.
