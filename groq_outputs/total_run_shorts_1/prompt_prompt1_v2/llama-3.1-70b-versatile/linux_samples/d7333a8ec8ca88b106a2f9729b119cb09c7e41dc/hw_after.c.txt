VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No known vulnerabilities have been detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be an excerpt from a larger C program that defines two structures, `ath11k_hw_hal_params_ipq8074` and `ath11k_hw_hal_params_qca6390`. These structures are used to store parameters related to the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for specific hardware platforms (IPQ8074 and QCA6390). The code does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or user input that is not properly sanitized.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were detected.
