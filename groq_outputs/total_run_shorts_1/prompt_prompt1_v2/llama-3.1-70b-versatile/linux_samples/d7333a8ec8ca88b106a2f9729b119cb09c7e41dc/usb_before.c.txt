VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential double-free or use-after-free vulnerability is present due to a missing check for a null pointer before calling kfree.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet does not perform a null check before freeing the memory allocated to the 'buf' pointer using kfree. If the memory allocation failed, 'buf' will be null, and kfree will attempt to free a null pointer, resulting in a crash. Furthermore, if 'buf' has already been freed elsewhere in the code not shown in this snippet, this could result in a double-free vulnerability, potentially leading to memory corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, add a null check before calling kfree. This will prevent potential crashes or memory corruption due to double-free or use-after-free vulnerabilities. 

```c
if (buf) {
    kfree(buf);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
                   le16_to_cpu(endpoint->wMaxPacketSize),
                   endpoint->bInterval);
        }
        urbcount = 0;

        pipe_num =
            ath6kl_usb_get_logical_pipe_num(ar_usb,
                             req,
                             USB_DIR_IN | USB_TYPE_VENDOR |
                             USB_RECIP_DEVICE, value, index, buf,
                             size, 2 * HZ);

    if (ret < 0) {
        ath6kl_warn("Failed to read usb control message: %d\n", ret);
        kfree(buf);
