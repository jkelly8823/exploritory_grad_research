VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Format String Injection vulnerability in the use of sprintf to construct a filename for proc_create_data.

EXPLANATION:
The sprintf function is used to construct a filename for proc_create_data, which includes a pointer value obtained from the sock variable. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious data into the filename, leading to unintended behavior or even code execution. This is particularly concerning in this context, where the filename is being passed to proc_create_data, which can potentially interact with the kernel.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid using sprintf to construct strings that include user-controlled data. Instead, consider using snprintf to ensure that the string is properly bounded and to prevent buffer overflow attacks. Additionally, you could consider using a different approach to generate the filename, such as using a static string or a formatted string that is not dependent on user-controlled data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct list_head tx_ops;
unsigned long dropped_usr_msgs;
struct proc_dir_entry *bcm_proc_read;
char procname [20]; /* pointer printed in ASCII with \0 */
};

static inline struct bcm_sock *bcm_sk(const struct sock *sk)
{

	if (proc_dir) {
		/* unique socket address as filename */
		sprintf(bo->procname, "%p", sock);
		bo->bcm_proc_read = proc_create_data(bo->procname, 0644,
						     proc_dir,
						     &bcm_proc_fops, sk);
	}
```
