VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet contains a resource leak vulnerability due to the incorrect handling of the indirect_pages list after a memory allocation failure.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, if `alloc_page` fails to allocate a page for `indirect_page`, the function jumps to `out_of_memory` using the `goto` statement. However, before this jump occurs, the function may have already successfully allocated `indirect_page` s and added them to the `indirect_pages` list. If `alloc_page` fails to allocate another `indirect_page`, the previously allocated `indirect_page` s are not properly cleaned up. As a result, these pages will leak and consume memory indefinitely.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is necessary to properly clean up any previously allocated `indirect_page` s when `alloc_page` fails to allocate another page. This can be achieved by introducing a loop that removes and frees all pages in the `indirect_pages` list when an allocation failure is encountered.

```c
for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    struct page *indirect_page = alloc_page(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO);
    if (!indirect_page) {
        // Iterate over indirect_pages list and free any pages that were previously allocated
        struct page *tmp;
        while (!list_empty(&rinfo->indirect_pages)) {
            INDIRECT_PAGE_LIST_ITER(tmp, &rinfo->indirect_pages) {
                list_del(&tmp->lru);
                __free_page(tmp);
            } end INDIRECT_PAGE_LIST_ITER(tmp, &rinfo->indirect_pages);
        }
        kfree(gnt_list_entry);
        goto out_of_memory;
    }
    list_add(&indirect_page->lru, &rinfo->indirect_pages);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
goto out_of_memory;

if (info->feature_persistent) {
    granted_page = alloc_page(GFP_NOIO | __GFP_ZERO);
    if (!granted_page) {
        kfree(gnt_list_entry);
        goto out_of_memory;
    }

BUG_ON(!list_empty(&rinfo->indirect_pages));
for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    struct page *indirect_page = alloc_page(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO);
    if (!indirect_page)
        goto out_of_memory;
    list_add(&indirect_page->lru, &rinfo->indirect_pages);
}
```
