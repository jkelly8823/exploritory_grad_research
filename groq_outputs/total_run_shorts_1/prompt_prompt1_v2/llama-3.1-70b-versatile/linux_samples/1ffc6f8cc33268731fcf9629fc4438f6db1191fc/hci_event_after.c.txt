VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Missing bounds checking in input parsing of &ev->bdaddr and &ev->link_type

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to handle an incoming Bluetooth connection. In line 3, the code logs the &ev->bdaddr pointer using the "%pMR" format specifier, and in line 5, it logs the same address with a message indicating a connection rejection. The problem lies in the potential for an invalid or untrusted address being printed. 

In the broader context of Bluetooth security, malicious devices can potentially send spoofed or truncated addresses, triggering vulnerabilities. The Bluetooth Core specification and various implementations often require addresses to be in a specific format (6 bytes, with certain rules for formatting the address fields).

Without bounds checking on the input address ev->bdaddr, it is possible that an attacker could send a truncated or modified address that could not be properly verified by the code. In the log message, this could potentially lead to an invalid read from process memory if &ev->bdaddr does not point to a valid, initialized 6 byte address.

Furthermore, this lack of checks could potentially be used to expose information about the process and system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize function arguments for validity. Assuming ev is an event or packet structure, add checks to ensure it contains valid addresses. 
2. Before logging the ev->bdaddr pointer, verify that its contents are indeed a valid Bluetooth address.

Here is a possible implementation:


	if (ev && ev->bdaddr && ev->bdaddr[0] != 0xFF && eve->bdaddr[5] != 0x00) {
		// log or process valid addresses only
		bt_dev_dbg(hdev, "bdaddr %pMR type 0x%x", &ev->bdaddr, ev->link_type);
		...
	}

ORIGINAL CODE:
bt_dev_dbg(hdev, "bdaddr %pMR type 0x%x", &ev->bdaddr, ev->link_type);

	/* Reject incoming connection from device with same BD ADDR against
	 * CVE-2020-26555
	 */
	if (!bacmp(&hdev->bdaddr, &ev->bdaddr))
	{
		bt_dev_dbg(hdev, "Reject connection with same BD_ADDR %pMR\n",
			   &ev->bdaddr);
		hci_reject_conn(hdev, &ev->bdaddr);
		return;
	}

	mask |= hci_proto_connect_ind(hdev, &ev->bdaddr, ev->link_type,
				      &flags);

	if (!(mask & HCI_LM_ACCEPT)) {
