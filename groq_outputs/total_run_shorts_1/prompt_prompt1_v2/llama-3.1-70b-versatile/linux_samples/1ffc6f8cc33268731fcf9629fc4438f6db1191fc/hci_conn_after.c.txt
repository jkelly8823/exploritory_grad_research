VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No identified vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be related to a Bluetooth device protocol, specifically handling of outgoing connections. It includes a check for a connection attempt to a device with the same Bluetooth Device Address (BD_ADDR) as itself and rejects such connections, citing CVE-2020-26555. This is a defense-in-depth measure that has already been mitigated by the programmer.

Further review did not disclose any vulnerabilties within this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	return ERR_PTR(-EOPNOTSUPP);
}

/* Reject outgoing connection to device with same BD ADDR against
 * CVE-2020-26555
 */
if (!bacmp(&hdev->bdaddr, dst)) {
	bt_dev_dbg(hdev, "Reject connection with same BD_ADDR %pMR\n",
			   dst);
	return ERR_PTR(-ECONNREFUSED);
}

acl = hci_conn_hash_lookup_ba(hdev, ACL_LINK, dst);
if (!acl) {
	acl = hci_conn_add(hdev, ACL_LINK, dst, HCI_ROLE_MASTER);
	if (!acl)
```
Please provide more context and/or surrounding code, it was unclear what happened upon acl evaluation failing
