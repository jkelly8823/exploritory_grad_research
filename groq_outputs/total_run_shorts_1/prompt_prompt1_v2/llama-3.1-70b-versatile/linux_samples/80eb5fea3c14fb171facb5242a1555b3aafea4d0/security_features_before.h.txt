VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a section of a C or C++ program that defines two preprocessor macros: `SEC_FTR_FLUSH_COUNT_CACHE` and `SEC_FTR_DEFAULT`. The definitions are straightforward and do not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. 
There is no dynamic memory allocation, no use of potentially vulnerable functions, and no manipulation of user-controlled data. The macros are merely used to define constants and do not have any potential for exploitation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary in this case. However, it is always a good idea to ensure that the constants defined in this snippet are used securely in the rest of the program. 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
// Software required to flush count cache on context switch
#define SEC_FTR_FLUSH_COUNT_CACHE	0x0000000000000400ull


// Features enabled by default
#define SEC_FTR_DEFAULT \
	(SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_HV | \
```
