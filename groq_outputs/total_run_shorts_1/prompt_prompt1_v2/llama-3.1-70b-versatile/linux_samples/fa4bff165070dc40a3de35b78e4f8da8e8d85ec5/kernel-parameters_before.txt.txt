	l2cr=		[PPC]

	l3cr=		[PPC]
			Format: <first>,<last>
			Specifies range of consoles to be captured by the MDA.

	mem=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT] Force usage of a specific amount of memory
			Amount of memory to be used when the kernel is not able

			[X86] Work as limiting max address. Use together
					       spec_store_bypass_disable=off [X86,PPC]
					       ssbd=force-off [ARM64]
					       l1tf=off [X86]

			auto (default)
				Mitigate all CPU vulnerabilities, but leave SMT
				enabled, even if it's vulnerable.  This is for
				if needed.  This is for users who always want to
				be fully mitigated, even if it means losing SMT.
				Equivalent to: l1tf=flush,nosmt [X86]

	mminit_loglevel=
			[KNL] When CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMORY_INIT is set, this
			parameter allows control of the logging verbosity for
