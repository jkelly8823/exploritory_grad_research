VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No discernible vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a series of macros and bitmasks for a Ceph distributed storage system. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, user input validation issues, or insecure data storage.
 
The macros are used to define feature flags and appear to follow proper naming conventions, consistent with the provided comments. There are no apparent issues with the use of bitmasks or flags in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Ensure proper maintenance and updates of the bitmasks and flags as the system evolves.
- Developers should be aware of the "reserved" and "deprecated" flags to avoid using them incorrectly.

DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE(60, 1, BLKIN_TRACING)  // *do not share this bit*

DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE(61, 1, RESERVED2)          // unused, but slow down!
DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE(62, 1, RESERVED)           // do not use; used as a sentinal
DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE_DEPRECATED(63, 1, RESERVED_BROKEN, LUMINOUS) // client-facing
