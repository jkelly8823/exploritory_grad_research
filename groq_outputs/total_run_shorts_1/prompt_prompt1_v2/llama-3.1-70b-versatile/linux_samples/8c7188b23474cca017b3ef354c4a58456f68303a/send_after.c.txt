VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None

EXPLANATION:
I have analyzed the provided code snippet for potential vulnerabilities, and I did not find any high-risk or exploitable issues in this code. The code appears to be checking for various conditions and handling error cases properly. There are no obvious signs of buffer overflow, SQL injection, or other security weaknesses.

However, I do want to note that the error codes used in this code (e.g., `-ENOTCONN` and `-EMSGSIZE`) are not relevant to the vulnerability analysis.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since I did not find any vulnerabilities in this code snippet, there are no recommendations for fixing potential vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	release_sock(sk);
}

lock_sock(sk);
if (daddr == 0 || rs->rs_bound_addr == 0) {
	release_sock(sk);
	ret = -ENOTCONN; /* XXX not a great errno */
	goto out;
}
release_sock(sk);

if (payload_len > rds_sk_sndbuf(rs)) {
	ret = -EMSGSIZE;
	goto out;
```
