VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No significant vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a socket implementation, handling error checking and buffer size verification. The code checks for invalid address conditions and ensures that the payload length does not exceed the send buffer size. The code structure is also defensive, with immediate error handling when issues are detected. No obvious injection, out-of-bounds, or other vulnerability-inducing issues were identified in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
    release_sock(sk);
}

/* racing with another thread binding seems ok here */
if (daddr == 0 || rs->rs_bound_addr == 0) {
    ret = -ENOTCONN; /* XXX not a great errno */
    goto out;
}

if (payload_len > rds_sk_sndbuf(rs)) {
    ret = -EMSGSIZE;
    goto out;
```
