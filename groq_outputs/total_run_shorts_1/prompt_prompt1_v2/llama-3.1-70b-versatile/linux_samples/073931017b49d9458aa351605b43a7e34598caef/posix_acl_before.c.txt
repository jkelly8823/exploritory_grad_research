VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a Linux kernel function that appears to be used for processing extended attributes for access control lists. The function seems to be designed to modify the uid and gid fields in posix acl extended attributes. However, without more context, we must evaluate what we have directly in front of us. 

After evaluating this segment of code, no specific vulnerability is present within the code snippet. There is an incomplete function definition, which may result in errors based upon context within the larger file, however based on this snippet of code alone I found no vulnerability to report.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No fixes recommended as no vulnerability was identified in this code snippet.
