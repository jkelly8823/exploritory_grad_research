VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. Specifically, the code sets `acl` to `NULL` and then continues to use it by calling `xfs_set_mode(inode, mode)`.

EXPLANATION:
The code fragment above has a conditional block that sets `acl` to `NULL` if `error` is less than or equal to zero. However, following this, `xfs_set_mode(inode, mode)` is called. The potential issue arises from the fact that setting `acl` to `NULL` after using it is permissible. However, further scrutiny of this code reveals that the actual vulnerable line lies not in the provided code snippet but rather in its calling function. Nevertheless, given the context of this code being potentially vulnerable, the actual problem, given the line of code which assigns acl to null and given the method posix_acl_equiv_mode uses acl immediately prior to that, that this does not stem from utilizing acl after its assigned the value null or not being set to null. However, this does mean that there's a remote chance the code that called the initial section is having issues as line 6 is possibly outside our section of evaluation here but from the portion provided acl will always remain non null.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Given the lack of code for the function xfs_set_mode and its defined parameters as well as posix_acl_equiv_mode function using acl we can recommend that you would need to give us additional information regarding functions which are possibly defined in another file.
- There's logically the following possible attack vectors from the method in our function given the information provided:
- We cannot verify lines may work (or have to) be logically elsewhere within this code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	return error;

	if (type == ACL_TYPE_ACCESS) {
		umode_t mode = inode->i_mode;
		error = posix_acl_equiv_mode(acl, &mode);

		if (error <= 0) {
			acl = NULL;

			if (error < 0)
				return error;
		}

		error = xfs_set_mode(inode, mode);
		if (error)
			return error;
	}
