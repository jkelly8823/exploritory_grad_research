VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of four function declarations. These functions appear to be related to manipulating Access Control Lists (ACLs) on file systems, specifically using the POSIX ACL API. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in these function declarations, as they simply define the interface for other functions to use. The actual implementation of these functions is not provided, but based on the declarations alone, no security issues are apparent.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided, as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern int posix_acl_chmod(struct inode *, umode_t);
extern int posix_acl_create(struct inode *, umode_t *, struct posix_acl **,
		struct posix_acl **);

extern int simple_set_acl(struct inode *, struct posix_acl *, int);
extern int simple_acl_create(struct inode *, struct inode *);
