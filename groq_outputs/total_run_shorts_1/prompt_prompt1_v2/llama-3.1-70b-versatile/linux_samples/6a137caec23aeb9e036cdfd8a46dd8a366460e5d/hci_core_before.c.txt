VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability was found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a larger system, possibly a Linux kernel module, responsible for managing network packet queues. The functionality seems to be a clean-up operation in case of an initialization failure.

Upon reviewing the code, there are no apparent signs of security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or unvalidated input. The code only performs local operations and does not seem to interact with external input.

The usage of `flush_work` functions and `skb_queue_purge` suggests proper synchronization and queue management, which are essential for preventing potential concurrency issues.

Since there is no indication of any security vulnerabilities in the given snippet, it has been marked as non-vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are provided, as the code does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    } else {
		/* Init failed, cleanup */
		flush_work(&hdev->tx_work);
		flush_work(&hdev->cmd_work);
		flush_work(&hdev->rx_work);

		skb_queue_purge(&hdev->cmd_q);
		skb_queue_purge(&hdev->rx_q);
