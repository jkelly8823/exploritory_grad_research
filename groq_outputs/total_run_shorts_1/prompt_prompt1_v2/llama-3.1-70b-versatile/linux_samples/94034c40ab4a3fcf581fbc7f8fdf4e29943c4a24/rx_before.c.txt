VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `pn` buffer.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the for loop where the `pn` buffer is incremented. If the initial value of `pn[IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN - 1]` is 255 (the maximum value for an unsigned char), then incrementing it will cause a wraparound, and subsequent increments of the previous bytes will not stop the loop. However, this is not the main issue. The main issue is that if the `pn` buffer is not null-terminated or its size is not properly validated before this operation, it can lead to a buffer overflow when incremented.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the size of the `pn` buffer is validated and its initialization is checked before performing the increment operation. Additionally, consider using a safer way to handle the increment operation, such as by checking for the maximum value before incrementing. Consider also using a bounds check to prevent the overflow.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
            * next fragment has a sequential PN value.
            */
            entry->check_sequential_pn = true;
            memcpy(entry->last_pn,
                   rx->key->u.ccmp.rx_pn[queue],
                   IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN);
            BUILD_BUG_ON(offsetof(struct ieee80211_key,

            if (!requires_sequential_pn(rx, fc))
                return RX_DROP_UNUSABLE;
            memcpy(pn, entry->last_pn, IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN);
            for (i = IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                pn[i]++;
                if (pn[i])
```
