VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not appear to contain any direct vulnerabilities. It consists of a struct definition for `debugfs` within an `#endif` block, and a comment explaining the structure of `key config`. There is no apparent data handling or function call that could indicate a potential vulnerability. However, without more context, such as the initial `#if` condition of the block or any function calls within the `debugfs` struct, we have limited ability to evaluate the code further.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
	} debugfs;
#endif

	/*
	 * key config, must be last because it contains key
	 * material as variable length member
	 */
