VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Stack Variable Overwrite Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be a part of a macro in assembly language. The code subtracts 32 bytes (8 * 4) from the stack pointer (`sp`) to allocate space for variables. Then, it stores the values of registers `x2` and `x3` at offset 0 of the allocated space, and `x0` and `x1` at offset 2. However, there exists a potential vulnerability in that the allocated stack space is not checked for sufficient size before storing values. Additionally, there lacks any safeguarding mechanism for the potential overwrite of sensitive data below the stack frame.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify that there is sufficient space on the stack before allocating.
2. Implement safeguarding mechanisms to prevent potential overwrite of data below the stack frame. This can be done by ensuring proper alignment and size requirements for stack variables.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	.popsection

.macro smccc_workaround_1 inst
	sub	sp, sp, #(8 * 4)
	stp	x2, x3, [sp, #(8 * 0)]
	stp	x0, x1, [sp, #(8 * 2)]
