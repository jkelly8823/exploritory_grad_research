VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded stack unwinding vulnerability in the qcom_link_stack_sanitization function
EXPLANATION:
The qcom_link_stack_sanitization function performs stack unwinding using a hardcoded sequence of instructions. This approach assumes that the stack layout is always the same, which may not be the case in all scenarios. By hardcoding the stack unwinding sequence, this code exposes itself to potential stack-based attacks. Additionally, the use of explicit assembly instructions and hardcoded values (e.g., ".rept 16") may lead to compatibility issues across different architectures or compilers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the stack unwinding sequence, consider using a more dynamic and platform-agnostic approach to stack unwinding. One possible solution is to use a standardized library or framework for stack unwinding that can adapt to different architectures and scenarios.

Here's an example of a more platform-agnostic approach:
```cpp
void qcom_link_stack_sanitization(void) {
  // Use a standardized library or framework for stack unwinding
  unwind_stack();
}
```
It is recommended to use established libraries or frameworks for this task, rather than rolling out a custom implementation. Popular libraries like libunwind or glibc's unwind module could be considered.

ORIGINAL CODE:
The original code is provided here, with the relevant function highlighted:
```c
static void qcom_link_stack_sanitization(void)
{
	u64 tmp;

	asm volatile("mov	%0, x30		\n"
		     ".rept	16		\n"
		     "bl	. + 4		\n"
		     ".endr			\n"
		     "mov	x30, %0		\n"
		     : "=&r" (tmp));
}
```

Note that while this code excerpt does not exhibit a common high-severity vulnerability such as buffer overflow, it is essential to follow the provided recommendations to write a more robust and secure code.
