VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a piece of assembly code, specifically written for an ARM-based system. It defines two entry points, `__qcom_hyp_sanitize_link_stack_start` and `__qcom_hyp_sanitize_link_stack_end`, which seem to be related to hypervisor functionality. The code also defines a macro `smccc_workaround_1` that performs some stack operations. After analyzing the code, no potential vulnerabilities or security issues were found. The code seems to be a low-level implementation of a specific functionality and does not appear to handle any user input or interact with external systems, which reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities were found.
