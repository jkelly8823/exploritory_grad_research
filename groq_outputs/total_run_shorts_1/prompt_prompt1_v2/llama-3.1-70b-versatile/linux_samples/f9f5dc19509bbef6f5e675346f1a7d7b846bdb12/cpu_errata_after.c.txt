VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 35-36
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
In-line Assembly and non-validated CPU Register Usage.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, we find a potential vulnerability on lines 35-36 in the function qcom_link_stack_sanitization. Within this function, we see the use of in-line assembly and CPU register direct usage which are set through an instruction. This usage is problematic, as the CPU registers are directly used and set without validating their values or which registers can be safely used. This is problematic in secure applications because malicious or compromised CPU registers can have devastating impacts on the execution environment. 

Non-validated CPU register use in inline assembly, such as x30 on line 35 and 37, allows for vulnerabilities such as register overwrite and manipulation. This will cause vulnerable stack handling during sanitization while directly accessing critical register values.

Moreover, performing direct inline-assembly can risk conflicts between the assembly's register choices and those chosen by the surrounding code or its compiler. Ensuring safety from this involves manually solving these register constraints.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure register choices don't conflict with the surrounding code, and validate and clean register values before manipulation, when in-line assembly usage is absolutely necessary. 
Validate function calls to unknown pointers from arbitrary functions such as install_bp_hardening_cb. 
However, since most usage for writing raw assembly such as this stems from an absence of higher-level support - typically refactor to avoid all of these for safety.
