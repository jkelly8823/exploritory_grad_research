VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a socket kernel function, specifically handling skb (socket buffer) cloning and memory allocation. The code checks for potential memory allocation errors and handles them properly. There do not seem to be any obvious security vulnerabilities in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as this code snippet does not present any evident vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (nsize < 0)
	nsize = 0;

if (unlikely((sk->sk_wmem_queued >> 1) > sk->sk_sndbuf)) {
	NET_INC_STATS(sock_net(sk), LINUX_MIB_TCPWQUEUETOOBIG);
	return -ENOMEM;
}

if (skb_unclone(skb, gfp))
	return -ENOMEM;

/* Get a new skb... force flag on. */
```
