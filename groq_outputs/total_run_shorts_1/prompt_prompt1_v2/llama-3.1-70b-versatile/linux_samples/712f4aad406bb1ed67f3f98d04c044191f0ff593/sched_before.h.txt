VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be from a C program and consists of straightforward variable declarations. There are no visible vulnerabilities present in this snippet.

The code declares several unsigned long variables for storing values related to memory allocation and a keyring structure. However, these declarations do not pose any security threats or potential vulnerabilities.

The use of struct pointer declarations for keyrings suggests that this code might be used for secure authentication and key management. However, the given snippet itself does not reveal any vulnerabilities related to this context.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned long mq_bytes;	/* How many bytes can be allocated to mqueue? */
#endif
unsigned long locked_shm; /* How many pages of mlocked shm ? */

#ifdef CONFIG_KEYS
struct key *uid_keyring;	/* UID specific keyring */
struct key *session_keyring;	/* UID's default session keyring */
```
