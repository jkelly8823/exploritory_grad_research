VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a segment of a C structure or data definitions, containing several unsigned long integers and pointers to struct key. It defines variables for tracking memory allocation and keyrings. No vulnerable patterns or operations were detected in this code. The variables and structures seem to be properly defined and no potential for buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other common vulnerabilities were found.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned long mq_bytes;	/* How many bytes can be allocated to mqueue? */

unsigned long locked_shm; /* How many pages of mlocked shm ? */
unsigned long unix_inflight;	/* How many files in flight in unix sockets */

#ifdef CONFIG_KEYS
struct key *uid_keyring;	/* UID specific keyring */
struct key *session_keyring;	/* UID's default session keyring */
