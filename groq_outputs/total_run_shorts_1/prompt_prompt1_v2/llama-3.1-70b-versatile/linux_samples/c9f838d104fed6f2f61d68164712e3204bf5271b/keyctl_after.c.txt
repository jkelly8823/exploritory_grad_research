VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8, 9, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a Time-Of-Check-To-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in the case KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING, and a switch-case fallthrough vulnerability in case KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING and case KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT.

EXPLANATION:
In the KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING case, the code calls install_process_keyring_to_cred(new) without checking if the current process keyring has changed between the check for existence and the installation. If the process keyring changes between these two points, this could potentially lead to incorrect key installations, resulting in a TOCTOU vulnerability.

Additionally, the provided code snippet uses switch-case statements, but it is missing the default case or any break statements to prevent fallthrough. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect key installations if an unhandled case is encountered.

Furthermore, in the KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT and KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING cases, there seems to be missing code or missing labels to handle these cases, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the TOCTOU vulnerability, you should check if the process keyring has changed between the existence check and the installation, and re-check existence if it has.

To fix the switch-case fallthrough vulnerability, you should add break statements at the end of each case to prevent fallthrough, or add a default case to handle unexpected cases.

You should also review and complete the missing code or labels for the KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT and KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING cases.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
* Read or set the default keyring in which request_key() will cache keys and
* return the old setting.
*
* If a thread or process keyring is specified then it will be created if it
* doesn't yet exist.  The old setting will be returned if successful.
