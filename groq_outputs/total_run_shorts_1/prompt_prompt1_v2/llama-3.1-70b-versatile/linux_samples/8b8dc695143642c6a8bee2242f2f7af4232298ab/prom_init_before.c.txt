VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Format String Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `prom_printf` function appears to be a wrapper for the standard `printf` function. However, the format string provided as the first argument does not guard against potential input formatting vulnerabilities. This format string includes a `%x` format specifier that is directly variable, and potentially controlled by an attacker. In the context of embedded systems programming (hinted by `CONFIG_PPC_EARLY_DEBUG_BOOTX` and `prom_printf`), this issue may pose more risks compared to other formats.

The main risk here is an attack based on the `%x` format specifier. Given the `addr` argument seems to be directly provided in a string format for `%x`, this seems to potentially pose more risks related to address exposure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider validating the incoming data before using it to construct a formatted string. Ensure that input does indeed satisfy minimum constraints applied over variables involved at a given format statement, including data types like an unsigned hexadecimal format string.
- Ensure that input characters with embedded user characters not only cover string escaping risks, but also a few user-controlled percentages will have any potential side effects suppressed prior formatting.
- Use fixed format string constants, ideally, enabling compiler optimization on internal runtime format handlers or even better inline substitutions when a general variable is kept hidden from public sources visibility.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
			prom_printf("W=%d H=%d LB=%d addr=0x%x\n",
				    width, height, pitch, addr);
			btext_setup_display(width, height, 8, pitch, addr);
		}
#endif /* CONFIG_PPC_EARLY_DEBUG_BOOTX */
	}
