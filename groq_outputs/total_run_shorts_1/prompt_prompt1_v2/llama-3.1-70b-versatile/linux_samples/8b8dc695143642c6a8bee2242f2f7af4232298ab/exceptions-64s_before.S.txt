VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of a low-level assembly language program, potentially handling an exception. It saves various values, including the DSISR (Data Storage Interrupt Status Register), CR (Condition Register), and other registers. The code also performs some bit manipulation and uses specific assembly instructions for kernel operations. After careful analysis, no potential security vulnerabilities, such as data corruption or unauthorized access, were identified in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided, as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
	mfspr	r11,SPRN_DSISR		/* Save DSISR */
	std	r11,_DSISR(r1)
	std	r9,_CCR(r1)		/* Save CR in stackframe */
	kuap_save_amr_and_lock r9, r10, cr1
	/* Save r9 through r13 from EXMC save area to stack frame. */
	EXCEPTION_PROLOG_COMMON_2(PACA_EXMC)
	mfmsr	r11			/* get MSR value */
