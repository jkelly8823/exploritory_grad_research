VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No potential vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be from a Linux kernel header file, specifying the DMA zone size for specific architectures. The code defines the DMA zone size based on whether the system is a PPC32 or not. This snippet is relatively simple and seems to be a legitimate configuration setting for different architectures. No obvious vulnerabilities, such as potential overflows, buffer overflows, or use-after-free, were detected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected.

#define ARCH_ZONE_DMA_BITS 31
