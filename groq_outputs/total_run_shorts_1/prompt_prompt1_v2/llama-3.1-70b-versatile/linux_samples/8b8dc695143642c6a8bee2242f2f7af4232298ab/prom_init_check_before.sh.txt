VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No exploitable vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a simple string assignment in a shell scripting context. The string `WHITELIST` is defined with various function names and variables, and the `NM` variable is assigned the value of the first command-line argument (`$1`). There are no obvious vulnerabilities, such as command injection, SQL injection, or buffer overflow issues, within this snippet.

While it's worth noting that using string assignments without proper validation or sanitization can potentially lead to issues, the provided code snippet doesn't exhibit any clear vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None are necessary at this time.
