VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected.
EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be a PowerPC assembly language exception handling routine. The operations are saving registers and MSR (Machine State Register) values, which is a common practice for exception handling. No obvious vulnerabilities or insecure code patterns were found in the provided code snippet. The registers and MSR are being saved correctly, and no user-controlled data is being manipulated in an insecure way.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
	mfspr	r11,SPRN_DSISR		/* Save DSISR */
	std	r11,_DSISR(r1)
	std	r9,_CCR(r1)		/* Save CR in stackframe */
	/* We don't touch AMR here, we never go to virtual mode */
	/* Save r9 through r13 from EXMC save area to stack frame. */
	EXCEPTION_PROLOG_COMMON_2(PACA_EXMC)
	mfmsr	r11			/* get MSR value */
