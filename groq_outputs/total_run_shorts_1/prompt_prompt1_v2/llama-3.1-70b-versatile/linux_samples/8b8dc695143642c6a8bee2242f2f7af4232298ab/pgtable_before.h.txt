VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a C function that checks PMD (Page Middle Directory) access permissions. The function calls other functions like `radix_enabled()`, `radix__pmd_bad()`, and `pmd_pte()`. It also defines a macro `pmd_access_permitted` that is immediately followed by the declaration of a function with the same name. This might seem unusual, but it's not necessarily a vulnerability.

The code snippet provided is incomplete, but based on the given information, no obvious vulnerabilities or potential issues were found.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities were detected. 
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
return false;
}

static inline int pmd_bad(pmd_t pmd)
{
	if (radix_enabled())
		return radix__pmd_bad(pmd);
#define pmd_access_permitted pmd_access_permitted
static inline bool pmd_access_permitted(pmd_t pmd, bool write)
{
	return pte_access_permitted(pmd_pte(pmd), write);
}

#ifdef CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE
