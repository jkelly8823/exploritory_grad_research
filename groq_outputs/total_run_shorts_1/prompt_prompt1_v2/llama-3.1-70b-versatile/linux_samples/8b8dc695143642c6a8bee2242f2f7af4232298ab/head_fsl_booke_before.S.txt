No identified vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be written in assembly language and is defining two exceptions for system calls and auxiliary processor unavailability. After analyzing the code, I did not find any potential vulnerabilities. The code is using exceptions to handle specific interrupts and does not involve any data processing or I/O operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.
