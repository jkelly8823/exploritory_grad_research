VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
  Potential memory leak due to inconsistent error handling.

EXPLANATION:
  In this code snippet, an error is checked for `ret` and if it's nonzero, the `end_write_bio()` function is called with `ret` as its argument. However, there is no corresponding protection against memory leaks in the case where `ret` is zero. This could potentially lead to memory not being released if an error occurs later in the function. Furthermore, the function seems to return early without cleaning up potential allocated memory.
 
  There's also another issue: if `flush_write_bio()` fails (indicated by a non-zero return value), `end_write_bio()` is called within a conditional that does not handle this case. It should be handled for both calls to ensure data integrity and clean up in the event of an error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  To avoid this potential vulnerability, you should also clean up remaining allocated memory in the case where `ret` is zero.
  ```c
    int ret = 0;
    int done = 0;
    int nr_to_write_done = 0;
    struct pagevec pvec;

    ret = flush_write_bio(&epd);
    if (ret != 0) {
        end_write_bio(&epd, ret);
    }
    return ret;
```

  If `end_write_bio()` is intended for additional cleanup other than memory release (it is currently unclear), you may still need to ensure that it is also called in the case of a nonzero `ret` in `flush_write_bio()` to prevent other resources being leaked.

  Additionally, it may be worth reviewing how the `return ret` statements affect any external calls, to ensure they propagate error codes appropriately.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
    .extent_locked = 0,
    .sync_io = wbc->sync_mode == WB_SYNC_ALL,
    };
    int ret = 0;
    int done = 0;
    int nr_to_write_done = 0;
    struct pagevec pvec;
    end_write_bio(&epd, ret);
    return ret;
}
    ret = flush_write_bio(&epd);
    return ret;
}
```
