VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory Leak due to Unchecked Allocation
EXPLANATION:
The code calls `kzalloc()` to allocate memory for the `umem` variable. However, it does not check the return value of `kzalloc()` to ensure that the allocation was successful. If `kzalloc()` fails and returns `NULL`, this will result in a null pointer dereference later in the code. Additionally, if an error occurred earlier in the function, memory may be leaked because `kzalloc()` can increase the kernel's memory usage.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should check the return value of `kzalloc()` and handle the case where `NULL` is returned. If memory allocation fails, an appropriate error code should be returned.

```c
umem = kzalloc(sizeof *umem, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!umem)
    return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);  // Return an error code if allocation fails
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (dmasync)
    dma_set_attr(DMA_ATTR_WRITE_BARRIER, &attrs);

if (!can_do_mlock())
    return ERR_PTR(-EPERM);

umem = kzalloc(sizeof *umem, GFP_KERNEL);
```
