VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to unbounded socket send buffer size.

EXPLANATION:
The code sets `tfile->sk.sk_sndbuf` to `INT_MAX`, which could lead to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. This is because a large send buffer size can cause the kernel to allocate excessive amounts of memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or even arbitrary code execution.

If an attacker can cause the socket to accept an excessive amount of data, the kernel may allocate more memory than it can handle, leading to a crash or potentially allowing the attacker to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input before setting the socket send buffer size to prevent excessive memory allocation.
2. Consider using a more reasonable and configurable value for the socket send buffer size instead of `INT_MAX`.
3. Consider adding error handling and bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
tfile->socket.file = file;
tfile->socket.ops = &tun_socket_ops;

sock_init_data_uid(&tfile->socket, &tfile->sk, current_fsuid());

tfile->sk.sk_write_space = tun_sock_write_space;
tfile->sk.sk_sndbuf = INT_MAX;
```
