VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be related to powerpc architecture and handling speculative execution. However, based on the given code snippet alone, no potential issues with information disclosure or buffer overflows could be identified. The use of conditional preprocessor directives (#ifdef, #else) seems to be properly handled. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
ORIGINAL CODE:

void setup_barrier_nospec(void);
#else
static inline void setup_barrier_nospec(void) { };
#endif
void do_barrier_nospec_fixups(bool enable);
