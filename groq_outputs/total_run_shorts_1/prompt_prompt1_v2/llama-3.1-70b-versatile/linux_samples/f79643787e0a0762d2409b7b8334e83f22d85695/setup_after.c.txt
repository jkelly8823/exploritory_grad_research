VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No apparent vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a portion of a larger function, and based on the visible function calls and conditional statements, there are no obvious vulnerabilities present. The provided code does not contain any user input validation or sanitization issues, buffer overflows, or other common types of vulnerabilities.

The use of conditional statements and function calls like `security_ftr_enabled()` suggests that the code is attempting to handle security-related functionality in a secure manner. However, without more context about the surrounding code, the purpose of this function, and the definitions of the functions being called, it is impossible to be 100% certain that there are no vulnerabilities present.

One potential issue is the fact that the type of the `enable` variable is not explicitly stated, which could lead to issues if it is not what is expected by the function calls being made. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine for certain whether this is an issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
setup_rfi_flush(types, enable);
setup_count_cache_flush();

enable = security_ftr_enabled(SEC_FTR_FAVOUR_SECURITY) &&
         security_ftr_enabled(SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_ENTRY);
setup_entry_flush(enable);
}

enum rtas_iov_fw_value_map {
