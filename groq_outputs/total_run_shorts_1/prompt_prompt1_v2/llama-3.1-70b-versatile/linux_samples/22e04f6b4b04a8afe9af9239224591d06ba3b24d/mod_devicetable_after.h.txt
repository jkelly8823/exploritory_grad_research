VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of a series of #define directives that assign constant integer values to various symbolic names. This code is used to define constants for input device IDs, including maximum values for different device types.

Upon examination, no obvious vulnerabilities or security issues were found in this code snippet. The use of #define directives for constant values is a standard and secure practice in C and C++ programming. The code is declarative and does not contain any executable statements, function calls, or external interactions that could potentially introduce security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
