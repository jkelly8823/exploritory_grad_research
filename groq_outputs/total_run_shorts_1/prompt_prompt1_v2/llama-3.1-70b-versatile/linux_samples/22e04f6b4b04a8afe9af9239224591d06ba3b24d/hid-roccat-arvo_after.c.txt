VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Input and Out-of-Range Input Validation
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to unvalidated input and out-of-range input validation. It uses the kstrtoul function to parse input from the variable 'buf', but does not properly validate the results. Specifically, it checks if the function returns an error and simply returns if an error occurs, but does not validate the range of the converted values.

However, the code does properly validate the range of the value stored in the variable 'profile', specifically checking if it's within the range 1-5. 

More broadly, the code is using the kstrtoul function to parse user input, which is acceptable. But if not used correctly, could be vulnerable to buffer overflow.

However, there are 3 redundant 'int retval;' declarations, which are assigned what would be different values at each declaration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the results of kstrtoul are validated correctly and the converted value is within the acceptable range for each variable.
2. Remove redundant 'int retval;' declarations.
3. Ensure that the source of 'buf' is trusted.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
unsigned long state;
int retval;

retval = kstrtoul(buf, 10, &state);
if (retval)
	return retval;

temp_buf.command = ARVO_COMMAND_MODE_KEY;
unsigned long key_mask;
int retval;

retval = kstrtoul(buf, 10, &key_mask);
if (retval)
	return retval;

temp_buf.command = ARVO_COMMAND_KEY_MASK;
unsigned long profile;
int retval;

retval = kstrtoul(buf, 10, &profile);
if (retval)
	return retval;

if (profile < 1 || profile > 5)
```
