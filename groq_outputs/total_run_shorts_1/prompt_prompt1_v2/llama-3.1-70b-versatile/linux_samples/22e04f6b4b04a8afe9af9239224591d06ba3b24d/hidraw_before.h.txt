VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be defining two struct types in C. There are no function calls or data operations that could potentially lead to a vulnerability in this snippet. The code defines a struct with a wait queue head, a HID device pointer, a device pointer, and a linked list head. It then defines another struct named hidraw_report without any members. Given the context of this code snippet, no vulnerabilities are apparent.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
wait_queue_head_t wait;
struct hid_device *hid;
struct device *dev;
struct list_head list;
};

struct hidraw_report {
```
