VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inconsistent return values and potential information disclosure vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The function appears to be handling HID data and filtering out certain events. However, the function returns 1 for both valid (256) and invalid (0) events. This inconsistency can lead to accidental suppression of valid events. Moreover, the fact that the function explicitly filters out certain events can inadvertently disclose information about the system's event handling behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use more descriptive return values or consider using an enumeration to clarify the meaning of the return value.
- Consider using a whitelist-based approach instead of manually filtering out invalid events to avoid accidentally suppressing valid events.

		return 1;
	/* Drop useless distance 0 events (on button clicks etc.) as well */
