VULNERABLE: YES/NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: Multiple occurrences, specific lines 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49, and also duplication mentioned below
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Duplicate code for parsing and validating input leads to unnecessary repetition and potential maintenance issues.
EXPLANATION:
The code evaluates input in multiple place with mostly identical code blocks. There are multiple occurrences of the same unconditional definition 'unsigned long val;' followed by calls to kstrtoul() and followed by conditional statements. However, potential duplicate definition and redefinition of 'val' causes unused redefinitions.
Duplicate definitions and assignments of the same variable are technically a problem as this might end up evaluating to true always and cause problems in different scenarios.

Even when the definitions are legal, we still have  duplicate blocks which will have a hard work handling when more lines are added to this as these will needlessly need to be modified in every places and re-duplicated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The duplicate code blocks should be extracted into a separate function that can be called from where necessary. For this to be accurate and successfully executed, re-usable variables from these functions will be required only once at the top as long as this continues in the broader part of the code. Additionally, add a loop handling the expected occurrences to reduce the amount of redundant and duplicated code. Consider renaming variables to describe what the value actually is (i.e. sensor width/height).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c

    report->field[0]->report_count < 1)
	return -EINVAL;

hid_hw_request(hdev, report, HID_REQ_GET_REPORT);
hid_hw_wait(hdev);
