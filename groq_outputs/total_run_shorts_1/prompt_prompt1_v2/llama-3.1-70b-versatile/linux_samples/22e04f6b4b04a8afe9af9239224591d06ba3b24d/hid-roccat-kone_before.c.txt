VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Possible out-of-bounds access or unexpected behavior due to unvalidated user input for `new_startup_profile`.

EXPLANATION:
The `strict_strtoul` function is used to parse a string to an unsigned long integer. However, in this case, the result is stored in `new_startup_profile`, which is compared to hard-coded bounds (1 to 5). While the function does check for errors and returns a non-zero value if an error occurs, it does not validate the input against these bounds before storing it in `new_startup_profile`.

However, the actual vulnerability arises in the fact that the error check on the bounds for new_startup_profile is not properly separating the condition for state checking from the start profile condition. Without brackets on the if statement on the state condition, if the state does not equal 0 and state does not equal 1, none of the following lines are read. 


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the new_startup_profile is fully validated and sanitized before being used in any further operations. 
2. Place brackets around the state condition statement so it's error is not accidentally skipped.
3.  Consider using a switch statement instead of if-else for state validation. 
4. Ensure state validation is also complete and proper.


ORIGINAL CODE:
	kone = hid_get_drvdata(dev_get_drvdata(dev));
	usb_dev = interface_to_usbdev(to_usb_interface(dev));

	retval = strict_strtoul(buf, 10, &state);
	if (retval)
		return retval;

	if (state != 0 && state != 1)
	kone = hid_get_drvdata(dev_get_drvdata(dev));
	usb_dev = interface_to_usbdev(to_usb_interface(dev));

	retval = strict_strtoul(buf, 10, &new_startup_profile);
	if (retval)
		return retval;

	if (new_startup_profile  < 1 || new_startup_profile > 5)
