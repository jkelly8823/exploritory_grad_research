VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
There are no vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is a Linux kernel module definition for a USB driver. It defines a table of HID device IDs for Roccat KonePure devices and specifies the module author, description, and license. The code does not contain any apparent security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or insecure data handling. However, the analysis is limited to the given code snippet, and a complete vulnerability assessment would require examining the entire module and its interactions with other code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, no recommended fixes are provided.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static const struct hid_device_id konepure_devices[] = {
	{ HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_ROCCAT, USB_DEVICE_ID_ROCCAT_KONEPURE) },
	{ HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_ROCCAT, USB_DEVICE_ID_ROCCAT_KONEPURE_OPTICAL) },
	{ }
};

MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(hid, konepure_devices);
module_exit(konepure_exit);
