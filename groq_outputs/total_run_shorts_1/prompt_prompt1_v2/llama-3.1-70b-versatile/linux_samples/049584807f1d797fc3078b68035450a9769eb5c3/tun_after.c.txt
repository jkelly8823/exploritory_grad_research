VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No potential vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is a conditional statement checking for an XDP program and setting a boolean variable based on the GSOffload type. It appears to be a part of a networking function, likely related to the Linux kernel's XDP (eXpress Data Path) feature. The code does not reveal any potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other security-related issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
bool skb_xdp = false;
struct page *page;

if (unlikely(datasize < ETH_HLEN))
	return -EINVAL;

xdp_prog = rcu_dereference(tun->xdp_prog);
if (xdp_prog) {
	if (gso->gso_type) {
		skb_xdp = true;
```
