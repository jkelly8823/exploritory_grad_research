VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability via Unvalidated Input

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to unvalidated user input. The `fwname` variable, which is constructed from user-provided input (`ver` and `params`), is used to load a firmware file using `request_firmware()`. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `ver` and `params` variables to inject malicious firmware.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `btusb_setup_intel_newgen_get_fw_name()` and `btusb_setup_intel_new_get_fw_name()` functions may not properly validate their input parameters. If an attacker can inject a specially crafted string into the `ver` or `params` variables, they could potentially escape the intended directory structure and load arbitrary firmware files.

Additionally, the error handling for the firmware loading process is inadequate. The code checks for errors in the `request_firmware()` function, but does not properly handle the case where the firmware file is successfully loaded, but contains malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* Validate the input parameters `ver` and `params` to ensure they conform to the expected format and do not contain malicious characters.
* Use a whitelist approach to restrict the firmware files that can be loaded to only those that are explicitly allowed.
* Implement additional error handling to detect and handle cases where the firmware file is successfully loaded, but contains malicious code.
* Consider using a secure firmware loading mechanism, such as a digitally signed firmware image, to prevent loading of malicious firmware.

btusb_setup_intel_newgen_get_fw_name(ver, fwname, sizeof(fwname), "sfi");
err = request_firmware(&fw, fwname, &hdev->dev);
if (err < 0) {
    bt_dev_err(hdev, "Failed to load Intel firmware file %s (%d)",
        fwname, err);
    return err;
}

bt_dev_info(hdev, "Found device firmware: %s", fwname);
err = btusb_setup_intel_new_get_fw_name(ver, params, fwname,
    sizeof(fwname), "sfi");
if (err < 0) {
    bt_dev_err(hdev, "Unsupported Intel firmware naming");
    return -EINVAL;
}

err = request_firmware(&fw, fwname, &hdev->dev);
if (err < 0) {
    bt_dev_err(hdev, "Failed to load Intel firmware file %s (%d)",
        fwname, err);
    return err;
}
