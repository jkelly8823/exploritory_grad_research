VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be cleaning up after a failed initialization. It flushes work queues, purges skb queues, and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The code does not involve user input, does not use potentially vulnerable functions, and does not involve memory management that could lead to overflows or use-after-free issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None needed. The provided code snippet appears to be secure.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
} else {
    /* Init failed, cleanup */
    flush_work(&hdev->tx_work);

    /* Since hci_rx_work() is possible to awake new cmd_work
     * it should be flushed first to avoid unexpected call of
     * hci_cmd_work()
     */
    flush_work(&hdev->rx_work);
    flush_work(&hdev->cmd_work);

    skb_queue_purge(&hdev->cmd_q);
    skb_queue_purge(&hdev->rx_q);
```
