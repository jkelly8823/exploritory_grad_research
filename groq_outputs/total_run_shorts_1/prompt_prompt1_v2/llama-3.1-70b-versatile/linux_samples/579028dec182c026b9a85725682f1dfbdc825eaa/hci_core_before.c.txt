VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a cleanup routine for a network device. The flush_work function is used to cancel pending work items, and the skb_queue_purge function is used to remove packets from a socket buffer queue. 

No obvious vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet. The functions used are standard Linux kernel functions, and the usage appears to be correct.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
} else {
	/* Init failed, cleanup */
	flush_work(&hdev->tx_work);
	flush_work(&hdev->cmd_work);
	flush_work(&hdev->rx_work);

	skb_queue_purge(&hdev->cmd_q);
	skb_queue_purge(&hdev->rx_q);
}
