VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability found is a potential memory leak due to an empty block in the `get_user_ns` function. 
EXPLANATION:
In the `get_user_ns` function, there is a block with an empty body `{ }`. This suggests that the function may have been intended to return a user namespace or perform some other operation, but the code for this is missing. If a pointer to an uninitialized or partially initialized `struct user_namespace` is returned by this function, it may cause incorrect behavior or crashes when used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should complete the implementation of the `get_user_ns` function to correctly return a `struct user_namespace *`. For example, you might want to return the `ns` parameter directly:

```c
static inline struct user_namespace *get_user_ns(struct user_namespace *ns)
{
return ns;
}
```
You should also review the code that calls `get_user_ns` to ensure it correctly handles a possibly null return value.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern ssize_t proc_uid_map_write(struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
extern ssize_t proc_gid_map_write(struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
extern ssize_t proc_projid_map_write(struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
#else

static inline struct user_namespace *get_user_ns(struct user_namespace *ns)
{
{
}

#endif

#endif /* _LINUX_USER_H */
```
