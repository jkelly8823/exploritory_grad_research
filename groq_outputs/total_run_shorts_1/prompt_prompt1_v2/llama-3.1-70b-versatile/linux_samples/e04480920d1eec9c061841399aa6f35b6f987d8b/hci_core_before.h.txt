VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities identified

EXPLANATION:
This segment of code is composed of function declarations for HCI (Host Controller Interface) related operations. After careful analysis, no potential vulnerabilities or security risks were identified. There are no function calls or operations that directly interact with user input or that directly manipulate memory. The provided code only defines function prototypes and does not include any implementation details that could introduce a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As no vulnerabilities were identified, there are no recommended fixes for this code snippet.
