VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Integer Overflow Vulnerability via signed addition
EXPLANATION:
 This vulnerability seems complex, but the lines do not contain any blatant obivious vulnerability such as an off-by-one error. However, a hidden risk with implicit typecasting through (u64) variable casting creates room for potential integer overflow if strict casting isn't forced and source variables 'a' and 'b' variables aren't forced as u64 via signextension prior. However, given  the language of choice and other variables involved not appearing to be vulnerable our more careful assessment finds vulnerability related with  'signed_add_overflows method.



RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Implementations need to better verify signed overflow using given cast type and have a more complete casting of operand variables to specific types. When the potential for overflow is relevant, it may be important to verify there is support and check overflow is being identified through taint with ((!(res >= INT64_MIN))) or ((!(res <= INT64_MAX))); . Alternatively, also better declare resultant var res and as s64 would be the prefered means of preventing a 3rd overflow scenario as cast result by either not casting result to s64

 s64 res = ((s64)(((u64)a + (u64)b) > INT64_MAX) ? INT64_MAX: (((((u64)a + (u64)b)) <= INT64_MAX) ? (((u64)a + (u64)b)) : INT64_MIN )  )

When dealing with complex scenarios integers will over/underflow and do not reliably indicate numeric overflow. Checking of cast overflow is important but is up to interpretation based on results sought whereas in standard checking the result res cannot be entirely incorrect due to the range that INT64_MIN and MAX present we may see a slightly better code reliability by the presented expression.
