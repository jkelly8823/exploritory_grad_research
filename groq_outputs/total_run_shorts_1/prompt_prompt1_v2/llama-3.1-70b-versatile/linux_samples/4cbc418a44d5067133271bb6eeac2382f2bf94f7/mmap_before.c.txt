VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be defining a constant array `protection_map` to store protection values for memory mapping. The array is initialized with values that represent different permissions (`__P000`, `__P001`, ..., `__S111`). The comment hints at the behavior of `PROT_EXEC` on arm64 for `MAP_SHARED` and `MAP_PRIVATE` memory mappings.

The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, unchecked user input, or potential null pointer dereferences. The use of the `__ro_after_init` attribute ensures that the array is initialized at compile time and cannot be modified at runtime, reducing the risk of data corruption or unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary in this case.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 * MAP_PRIVATE	r: (no) no	r: (yes) yes	r: (no) yes	r: (no) yes
 *		w: (no) no	w: (no) no	w: (copy) copy	w: (no) no
 *		x: (no) no	x: (no) yes	x: (no) yes	x: (yes) yes
 *
 * On arm64, PROT_EXEC has the following behaviour for both MAP_SHARED and
 * MAP_PRIVATE:
 *								r: (no) no
 *								w: (no) no
 *								x: (yes) yes
