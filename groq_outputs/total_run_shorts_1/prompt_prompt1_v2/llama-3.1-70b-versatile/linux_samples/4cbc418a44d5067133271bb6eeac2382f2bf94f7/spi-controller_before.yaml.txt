VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a YAML schema definition, specifically defining two SPI bus width properties: spi-rx-bus-width and spi-tx-bus-width. It includes data type definitions, enumeration, and default values for these properties. The code snippet does not contain any executable code that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities. The definitions provided are for schema validation and data type enforcement, which do not pose a security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are required, as none were found. However, it is good practice to validate user input against the schema definition to prevent potential data corruption or errors.
