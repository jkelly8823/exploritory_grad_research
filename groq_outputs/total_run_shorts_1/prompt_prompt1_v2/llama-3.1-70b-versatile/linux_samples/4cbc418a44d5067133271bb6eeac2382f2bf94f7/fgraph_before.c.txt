VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a function definition in C, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The code defines a function `function_graph_enter` with four parameters, and it declares a local variable `trace` of type `struct ftrace_graph_ent`. There are no operations that involve user input, pointer arithmetic, or memory access that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return 0;
}

int function_graph_enter(unsigned long ret, unsigned long func,
			 unsigned long frame_pointer, unsigned long *retp)
{
	struct ftrace_graph_ent trace;
```
