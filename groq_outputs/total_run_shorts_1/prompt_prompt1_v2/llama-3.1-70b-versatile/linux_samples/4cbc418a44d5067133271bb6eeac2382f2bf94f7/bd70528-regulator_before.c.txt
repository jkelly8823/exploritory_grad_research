VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a kernel module or a device driver, and it defines two structures for regulator operations. The functions assigned to these structures seem to be properly defined within the kernel framework. There are no apparent uses of untrusted or user-provided input, no format string vulnerabilities, no use of potentially insecure functions, and no potential buffer overflows.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	.set_voltage_sel = regulator_set_voltage_sel_regmap,
	.get_voltage_sel = regulator_get_voltage_sel_regmap,
	.set_voltage_time_sel = regulator_set_voltage_time_sel,
	.set_ramp_delay = bd70528_set_ramp_delay,
};

static const struct regulator_ops bd70528_led_ops = {
	.enable = regulator_enable_regmap,
