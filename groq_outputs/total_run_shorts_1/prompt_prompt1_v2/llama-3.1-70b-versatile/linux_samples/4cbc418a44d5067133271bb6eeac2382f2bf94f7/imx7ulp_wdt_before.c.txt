VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential Deadlock and Infinite Loop vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided enables a watchdog timer (WD) and sets its timeout to 1 unit. It then enters an infinite loop without any condition or signal that can break out of the loop. This loop might block execution of the watchdog timer's interrupt handler.

Since the timeout is set to 1 unit, it is likely that the watchdog timer will expire and cause a reset or interrupt. However, the infinite loop prevents the system from completing its normal shutdown procedure or handling the watchdog interrupt, and if the watchdog is configured to reset the system, the system may enter a continuous reset loop.

Moreover, this loop prevents other tasks from executing, potentially causing the system to hang or fail to respond.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- The loop should be modified to somehow end or break out, which can be after some condition or signal is received.
- Implement proper watchdog handling, such as properly reacting to watchdog timer expires and resetting the watchdog after each successful operation.
- Usage of a tight loop should be considered as a last resort. Prefer to use a kernel timer or task sleep/wake mechanism instead.
- Error handling for watchdog timer operations should also be considered.

ORIGINAL CODE:
{
	struct imx7ulp_wdt_device *wdt = watchdog_get_drvdata(wdog);

	imx7ulp_wdt_enable(wdt->base, true);
	imx7ulp_wdt_set_timeout(&wdt->wdd, 1);

	/* wait for wdog to fire */
	while (true)
}
