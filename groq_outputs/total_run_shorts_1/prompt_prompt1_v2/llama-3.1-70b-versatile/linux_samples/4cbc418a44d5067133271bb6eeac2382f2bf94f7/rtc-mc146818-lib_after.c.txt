VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be reading and writing data to and from CMOS memory, which is a common practice in embedded systems. There is no indication of any inherent vulnerabilities in this code, such as buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or potential resource leaks. The code is simple, and there is no complex logic that might introduce vulnerabilities.
 
The code does contain conditional compilation based on the configuration option CONFIG_MACH_DECSTATION. However, this is a legitimate use of a predefined configuration option, and it does not introduce any vulnerabilities.
 
The CMOS functions (CMOS_READ and CMOS_WRITE) may introduce potential timing-based side-channel vulnerabilities if the underlying hardware does not provide protection mechanisms for access to CMOS memory. However, this vulnerability would be due to the hardware and not the code snippet provided. 
 For an exhaustive analysis, a full audit of the surrounding code is needed.
 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required.
 The snippet appears to be properly handling CMOS access and no visible security vulnerabilities are present.
 
ORIGINAL CODE:
save_control = CMOS_READ(RTC_CONTROL);
CMOS_WRITE((save_control|RTC_SET), RTC_CONTROL);
save_freq_select = CMOS_READ(RTC_FREQ_SELECT);
CMOS_WRITE((save_freq_select|RTC_DIV_RESET2), RTC_FREQ_SELECT);

#ifdef CONFIG_MACH_DECSTATION
CMOS_WRITE(real_yrs, RTC_DEC_YEAR);
#endif
