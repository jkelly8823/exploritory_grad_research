VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No known vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a header file for a KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation in Linux. It defines a struct for caching GFN-to-PFN mappings and includes an enum for memory region changes, but the details of the enum are not provided.

The provided code does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is essential to note that the lack of vulnerability detection in this snippet does not necessarily mean the entire codebase is secure, as this is only a small part of a larger system.

Given the missing information and potential context of the rest of the code, a thorough review of the entire codebase would be required to identify potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for this specific snippet are provided.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
enum kvm_mr_change;

#include <linux/types.h>

/*
 * Address types:
 *
	struct kvm_memory_slot *memslot;
};

struct gfn_to_pfn_cache {
	u64 generation;
	gfn_t gfn;
	kvm_pfn_t pfn;
	bool dirty;
};

#endif /* __KVM_TYPES_H__ */
