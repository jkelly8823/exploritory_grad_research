VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer division by zero vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerable lines (8-9) involve integer division using the `div64_ul` function. This function divides `stddev` by `(rec->counter * (rec->counter - 1) * 1000)`. However, no check is performed before this division to ensure that the divisor is non-zero. If `rec->counter` or `(rec->counter - 1)` is zero, this would result in an integer division by zero, causing a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend adding a check to ensure that the divisor is non-zero before performing the division. Here is an example of how the code can be modified:

```c
if (rec->counter > 1 && rec->counter * (rec->counter - 1) * 1000 != 0) {
    stddev = div64_ul(stddev, rec->counter * (rec->counter - 1) * 1000);
} else {
    // Handle the case where the divisor is zero
    // For example, set stddev to a default value or return an error
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
}

#ifdef CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
avg = div64_ul(rec->time, rec->counter);
if (tracing_thresh && (avg < tracing_thresh))
    goto out;
#endif

    /*
     * Divide only 1000 for ns^2 -> us^2 conversion.
     * trace_print_graph_duration will divide 1000 again.
     */
    stddev = div64_ul(stddev,
              rec->counter * (rec->counter - 1) * 1000);
}

trace_seq_init(&s);
trace_print_graph_duration(rec->time, &s);
```
