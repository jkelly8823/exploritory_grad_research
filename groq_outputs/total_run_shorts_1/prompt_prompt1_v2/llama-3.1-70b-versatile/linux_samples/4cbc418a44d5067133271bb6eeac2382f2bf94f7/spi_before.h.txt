VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a collection of function declarations and an extern function declaration. It does not contain any implementation, and thus does not provide enough context for vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, use after free, or other common issues. The code appears to be a part of the spi driver and does not seem to have any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations can be made for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:
/* Helper calls for driver to timestamp transfer */
void spi_take_timestamp_pre(struct spi_controller *ctlr,
			    struct spi_transfer *xfer,
			    const void *tx, bool irqs_off);
void spi_take_timestamp_post(struct spi_controller *ctlr,
			     struct spi_transfer *xfer,
			     const void *tx, bool irqs_off);

/* the spi driver core manages memory for the spi_controller classdev */
extern struct spi_controller *__spi_alloc_controller(struct device *host,
						unsigned int size, bool slave);
