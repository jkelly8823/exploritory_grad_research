VULNERABLE: NO

This version contains no input and does not display an apparent chance of causing an error to occur, however in this context there is line that stores user input in certain registers, 'ld	r12, [sp, PT_sp + 4]' and 'ld	r30, [sp, PT_sp + 8]', that could possibly allow for possibility of being vulnerable based on given information however given context does offer correct validation of those variables therefore under given snippet is ranked as not vulnerable.

VULNERABLE_LINES: None

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a part of an assembly code, specifically designed for an ARC processor. It seems to be involved in managing the stack and registers for context switching. Given the information and context provided, there are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are required for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ARC_HAS_ACCL_REGS
	ST2	r58, r59, PT_sp + 12
#endif

.endm


	LD2	gp, fp, PT_r26		; gp (r26), fp (r27)

	ld	r12, [sp, PT_sp + 4]
	ld	r30, [sp, PT_sp + 8]

	; Restore SP (into AUX_USER_SP) only if returning to U mode
	;  - for K mode, it will be implicitly restored as stack is unwound
	;  - Z flag set on K is inverse of what hardware does on interrupt entry
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_ARC_HAS_ACCL_REGS
	LD2	r58, r59, PT_sp + 12
#endif
.endm
