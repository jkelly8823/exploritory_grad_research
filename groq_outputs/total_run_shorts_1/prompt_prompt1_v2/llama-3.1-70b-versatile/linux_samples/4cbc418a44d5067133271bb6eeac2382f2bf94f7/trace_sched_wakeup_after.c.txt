VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential information disclosure vulnerability due to the inclusion of sensitive error messages.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a printk statement that outputs an error message "failed to start wakeup tracer" to the kernel error log. However, the same error message is not being checked for a specific error code, which might not be sufficient in a production environment. This could potentially lead to information disclosure, revealing details about system internals or current state to unauthorized parties.

In the vulnerability line(s), ret is also being used to print a different error message, but it is not being used in the printk statement. The 'ret' variable is being assigned a return value from some previous function call which isn't visible in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using more generic error messages or messages without specific details.
- Always ensure that return values of functions are evaluated properly and error codes are handled properly.
- Remove error messages which are too verbose about internal states. Instead of printing sensitive information, consider logging it in a secure location.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	if (ret) {
		pr_info("wakeup trace: Couldn't activate tracepoint"
			" probe to kernel_sched_migrate_task\n");
		goto fail_deprobe_sched_switch;
	}

	wakeup_reset(tr);

		printk(KERN_ERR "failed to start wakeup tracer\n");

	return;
fail_deprobe_sched_switch:
	unregister_trace_sched_switch(probe_wakeup_sched_switch, NULL);
fail_deprobe_wake_new:
	unregister_trace_sched_wakeup_new(probe_wakeup, NULL);
fail_deprobe:
	unregister_trace_sched_wakeup(probe_wakeup, NULL);
