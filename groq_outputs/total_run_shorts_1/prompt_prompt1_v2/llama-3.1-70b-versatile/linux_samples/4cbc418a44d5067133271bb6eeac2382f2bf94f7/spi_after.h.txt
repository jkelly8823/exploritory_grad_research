VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a function declaration or interface definition for a SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) driver in a Linux kernel module. The function declarations and extern declarations seem to be correctly defined and follow standard practices. There are no obvious signs of vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or unchecked user input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No changes are recommended for this code snippet as it does not seem to contain any vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
/* Helper calls for driver to timestamp transfer */
void spi_take_timestamp_pre(struct spi_controller *ctlr,
			    struct spi_transfer *xfer,
			    size_t progress, bool irqs_off);
void spi_take_timestamp_post(struct spi_controller *ctlr,
			     struct spi_transfer *xfer,
			     size_t progress, bool irqs_off);

/* the spi driver core manages memory for the spi_controller classdev */
extern struct spi_controller *__spi_alloc_controller(struct device *host,
						unsigned int size, bool slave);
