VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Division by potentially small value.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the division operation. Specifically, lines 10 and 11 perform division operations by `rec->counter` and `rec->counter - 1` respectively. If `rec->counter` or `rec->counter - 1` is close to zero, the division operation may yield incorrect or very large results. This can lead to an incorrect calculation of `stddev`.

In addition, if `rec->counter` is zero, the division operation will result in a division by zero error. This will likely cause the program to crash or terminate abnormally. 

It is worth noting that the code specifically mentions dividing only 1000 for a unit conversion, but does not explicitly check if the divisor is zero or near zero.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, check if `rec->counter` and `rec->counter - 1` are non-zero before performing the division operations. A simple conditional check can be added to ensure that division by zero or a very small value does not occur.

```c
if (rec->counter > 1) {
    do_div(stddev, rec->counter * (rec->counter - 1) * 1000);
}
else {
    // Handle the case when divisor is zero or near zero
    // This could be an error, or simply set stddev to a sentinel value
    stddev = 0;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

#ifdef CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
	avg = rec->time;
	do_div(avg, rec->counter);

		do_div(stddev, rec->counter * (rec->counter - 1) * 1000);

	trace_seq_init(&s);
	trace_print_graph_duration(rec->time, &s);
