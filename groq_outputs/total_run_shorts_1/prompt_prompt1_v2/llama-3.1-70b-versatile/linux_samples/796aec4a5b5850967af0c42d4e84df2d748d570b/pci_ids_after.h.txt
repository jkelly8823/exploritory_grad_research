VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines several hexadecimal constants for PCI device IDs using macros in C. The use of defines with clear and descriptive names does not raise any security concerns. There is no visible interaction with external inputs or dynamic memory allocation that could lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required. The given code snippet does not present any security-related concerns.
