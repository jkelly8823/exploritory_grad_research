VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to define constants for flags used in memory management functions. The values are clearly defined in a macro format, and there are no indications of potential security vulnerabilities, such as command injection, buffer overflows, or data leakage.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for security fixes are necessary in this case.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#else
# define MAP_UNINITIALIZED 0x0		/* Don't support this flag */
#endif

/* 0x0100 - 0x80000 flags are defined in asm-generic/mman.h */
#define MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE	0x100000	/* MAP_FIXED which doesn't unmap underlying mapping */

/*
 * Flags for mlock
 */
