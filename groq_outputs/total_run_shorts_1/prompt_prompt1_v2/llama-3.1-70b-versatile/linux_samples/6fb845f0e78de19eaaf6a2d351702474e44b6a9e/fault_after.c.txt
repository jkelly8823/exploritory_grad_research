VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-4, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow attack due to the bitwise OR operation used to construct the address. Additionally, the code may be vulnerable to information disclosure due to the use of the `pr_alert` function.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet constructs an address by performing bitwise OR operations on multiple variables. If the variables `desc.base0`, `desc.base1`, `desc.base2`, and `desc.base3` have values that exceed the maximum limit for their respective shift operations, it could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow could cause unexpected behavior in the system.
Moreover, the `pr_alert` function is used to print error messages that contain potentially sensitive information, including the constructed address and its components.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent integer overflows, it is recommended to:
- Perform bounds checking on the variables `desc.base0`, `desc.base1`, `desc.base2`, and `desc.base3` before constructing the address.
- Consider using safer data types, such as `uint64_t`, to prevent overflows.

To prevent information disclosure, consider replacing the `pr_alert` function with a function that does not output sensitive information, such as `pr_err` or a custom logging function.

Additionally, consider validating user input and checking for potential errors in the DESC structure before constructing the address.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	return;
}

addr = desc.base0 | (desc.base1 << 16) | ((unsigned long)desc.base2 << 24);
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
addr |= ((u64)desc.base3 << 32);
#endif
pr_alert("%s: 0x%hx -- base=0x%lx limit=0x%x\n",
```
