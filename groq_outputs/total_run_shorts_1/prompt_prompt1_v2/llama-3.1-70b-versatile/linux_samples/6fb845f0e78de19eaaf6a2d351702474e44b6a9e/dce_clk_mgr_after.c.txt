VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a graphics processing unit (GPU) or display configuration module. The code is used to calculate and set display clock frequencies based on the number of streams and other factors. After analyzing the code, I did not find any signs of potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of deprecated functions, or insecure data handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:

 dc,
 context->bw.dce.sclk_khz);

 /*
  * As workaround for >4x4K lightup set dcfclock to min_engine_clock value.
  * This is not required for less than 5 displays,
  * thus don't request decfclk in dc to avoid impact
  * on power saving.
  *
 */
 pp_display_cfg->min_dcfclock_khz = (context->stream_count > 4)?
 context->bw.dce.min_engine_clock_khz : 0;

 pp_display_cfg->min_engine_clock_deep_sleep_khz
  = context->bw.dce.sclk_deep_sleep_khz;
