VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to invalid error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to get the clock device with `devm_clk_get`, but in case of an error, it immediately returns an error value without disabling any previously enabled clocks. This can lead to a resource leak, where clocks are left in an enabled state. 

The correct behavior would be to disable and unprepare the previously enabled clock before returning an error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a call to `sun4i_tcon_free_clocks` to disable and unprepare the `sclk0` clock before returning an error. The corrected code would look like this:

```c
if (IS_ERR(tcon->sclk1)) {
    sun4i_tcon_free_clocks(tcon);
    return PTR_ERR(tcon->sclk1);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
			return PTR_ERR(tcon->sclk0);
		}
	}
	clk_prepare_enable(tcon->sclk0);

	if (tcon->quirks->has_channel_1) {
		tcon->sclk1 = devm_clk_get(dev, "tcon-ch1");
		if (IS_ERR(tcon->sclk1)) {

static void sun4i_tcon_free_clocks(struct sun4i_tcon *tcon)
{
	clk_disable_unprepare(tcon->sclk0);
	clk_disable_unprepare(tcon->clk);
}
