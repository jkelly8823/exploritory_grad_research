VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a memory management system, specifically dealing with page directories and page tables. The functions defined here are for setting page directory entries (PDEs) and page table entries (PTEs) at specific addresses.

The code does not appear to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It does not deal with user input, and it does not have any obvious data races or use-after-free issues.

There are no signs of buffer overflow, use of insecure functions (such as `strcpy`, `strcat`, etc.), nor are there any pointer arithmetics that can easily lead to buffer overflows.

Overall, this code appears to be well-written and secure, considering the provided context.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None, as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static inline void set_pmd_at(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr,
			      pmd_t *pmdp, pmd_t pmd)
{
	native_set_pmd(pmdp, pmd);
}

static inline void set_pud_at(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr,
			      pud_t *pudp, pud_t pud)
```
