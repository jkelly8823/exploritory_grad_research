VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a memory management system in Linux. It defines two inline functions, `set_pmd_at` and `set_pud_at`, which set page directory and upper directory entries in a memory map. After analyzing the provided code, no obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, data leaks, or unauthorized access were detected.

The code does not seem to perform any user-supplied input validation, but without seeing the context of the function calls, it's difficult to say whether this is a potential vulnerability or simply not in the current code snippet. Additionally, there are no red flags in terms of memory management, pointer arithmetic, or function calls that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not appear to have any security vulnerabilities that require fixing.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static inline void set_pmd_at(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr,
			      pmd_t *pmdp, pmd_t pmd)
{
	set_pmd(pmdp, pmd);
}

static inline void set_pud_at(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr,
			      pud_t *pudp, pud_t pud)
```
