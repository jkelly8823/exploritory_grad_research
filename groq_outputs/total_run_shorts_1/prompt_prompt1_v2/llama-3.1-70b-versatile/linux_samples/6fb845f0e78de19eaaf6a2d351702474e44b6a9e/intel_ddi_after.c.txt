VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No detectable vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be part of a larger switch statement, handling different cases for DPLL IDs. It checks for specific cases and returns corresponding clock selections or calls a MISSING_CASE function otherwise. Although there are some potential issues that could be raised about the MISSING_CASE function (e.g., it seems to be called directly without being declared in the provided snippet), it's difficult to accurately assess these given the missing context.

However, within the snippet itself, I couldn't identify any detectable vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflow, or other common code vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since there are no detectable vulnerabilities, there are no recommended fixes for this code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
			return DDI_CLK_SEL_TBT_810;
		default:
			MISSING_CASE(clock);
			return DDI_CLK_SEL_NONE;
		}
	case DPLL_ID_ICL_MGPLL1:
	case DPLL_ID_ICL_MGPLL2:
	case DPLL_ID_ICL_MGPLL3:
