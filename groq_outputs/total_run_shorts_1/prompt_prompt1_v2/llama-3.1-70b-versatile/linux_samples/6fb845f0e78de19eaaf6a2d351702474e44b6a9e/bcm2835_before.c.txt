VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be an error handling block from a C function, likely in a Linux kernel module. The code logs an error message using `dev_dbg`, frees the `mmc` host using `mmc_free_host`, and returns the error value `ret`. I was unable to identify any potential vulnerabilities in the given code snippet.

No recommended fixes are required for this code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
err:
	dev_dbg(dev, "%s -> err %d\n", __func__, ret);
