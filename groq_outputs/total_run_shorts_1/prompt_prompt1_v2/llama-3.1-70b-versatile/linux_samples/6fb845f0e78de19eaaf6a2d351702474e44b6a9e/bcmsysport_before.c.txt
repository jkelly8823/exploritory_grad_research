VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `put_unaligned_be16` and `put_unaligned_be32` functions, as well as the `get_unaligned_be16` and `get_unaligned_be32` functions.

EXPLANATION:
The `put_unaligned_be16` and `put_unaligned_be32` functions are writing data to the `wol->sopass` buffer without performing any bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `wol->sopass` buffer is not large enough to hold the data being written. Similarly, the `get_unaligned_be16` and `get_unaligned_be32` functions are reading data from the `wol->sopass` buffer without performing any bounds checking, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to add bounds checking to ensure that the `wol->sopass` buffer is large enough to hold the data being written or read. This can be achieved by checking the size of the `wol->sopass` buffer before writing or reading data to/from it.

Additionally, it is recommended to use safer functions that perform bounds checking, such as `memcpy` or `memset`, instead of `put_unaligned_be16`, `put_unaligned_be32`, `get_unaligned_be16`, and `get_unaligned_be32`.
