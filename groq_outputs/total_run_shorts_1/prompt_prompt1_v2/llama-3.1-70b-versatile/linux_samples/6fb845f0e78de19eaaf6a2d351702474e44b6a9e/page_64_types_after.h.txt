VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a series of preprocessor directives that define a value for `KASAN_STACK_ORDER` based on the configuration of the kernel address sanitizer (KASAN) feature. The code appears to be using standard and safe programming practices.

The use of `ifdef` and `ifndef` directives to conditionally compile code based on configuration options is common and safe. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of uninitialized variables, or other issues that could lead to security breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as the code appears to be secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_KASAN
#ifdef CONFIG_KASAN_EXTRA
#define KASAN_STACK_ORDER 2
#else
#define KASAN_STACK_ORDER 1
#endif
#else
#define KASAN_STACK_ORDER 0
#endif
