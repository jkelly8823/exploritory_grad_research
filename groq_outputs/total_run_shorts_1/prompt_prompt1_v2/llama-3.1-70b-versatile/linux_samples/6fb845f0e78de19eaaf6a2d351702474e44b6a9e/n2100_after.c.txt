VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This is a short and innocuous code snippet that does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It defines a function to determine the IRQ line for a specific PCI slot and pin. The input parameters are clearly defined, and the code checks the PCI slot before proceeding. There is no user input or data being processed that could pose a risk of vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. This code snippet does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int n2100_pci_map_irq(const struct pci_dev *dev, u8 slot, u8 pin)
{
    int irq;

    if (PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn) == 1) {
```
