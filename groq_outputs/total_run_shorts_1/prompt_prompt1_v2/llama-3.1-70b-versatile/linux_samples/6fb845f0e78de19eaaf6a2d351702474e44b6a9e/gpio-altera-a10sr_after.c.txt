VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Magic numbers are used in the code, making it less maintainable and readable.
EXPLANATION:
Magic numbers are used in the code (`ALTR_A10SR_OUT_VALID_RANGE_HI`, `ALTR_A10SR_LED_VALID_SHIFT`, `EINVAL`, `0`). While these numbers may have specific meanings in the context of this code, their use without clear definitions makes the code harder to understand for someone not familiar with these numbers. `EINVAL` (22) is defined in the Linux kernel, however, without seeing more code it can be assumed to be an error value used for 'Invalid argument', and `0` seems to indicate success. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Magic numbers should be replaced with meaningful named constants where possible. For example, `ALTR_A10SR_OUT_VALID_RANGE_HI`, `ALTR_A10SR_LED_VALID_SHIFT`, `EINVAL` should be defined clearly in the code, and a named constant should be defined for the return value of `0` (e.g. `GPIO_SUCCESS`). If these values are custom and used in other parts of the code, consider defining them in a separate file or header.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int altr_a10sr_gpio_direction_output(struct gpio_chip *gc,
					    unsigned int nr, int value)
{
	if (nr <= (ALTR_A10SR_OUT_VALID_RANGE_HI - ALTR_A10SR_LED_VALID_SHIFT)) {
		altr_a10sr_gpio_set(gc, nr, value);
		return 0;
	}
	return -EINVAL;
}

static const struct gpio_chip altr_a10sr_gc = {
