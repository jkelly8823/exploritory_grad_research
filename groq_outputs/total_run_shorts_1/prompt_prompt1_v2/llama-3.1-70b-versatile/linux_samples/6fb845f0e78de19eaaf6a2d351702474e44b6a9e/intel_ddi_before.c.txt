VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of a switch statement in C, handling different cases related to DPLL IDs. The code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of unchecked user input, or insecure data handling.

There is a function call to `MISSING_CASE(clock)` in the default case, which may potentially be used for error handling or logging. However, without more context about the implementation of `MISSING_CASE`, we cannot determine if it poses any security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are provided as none were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:

			return DDI_CLK_SEL_TBT_810;
		default:
			MISSING_CASE(clock);
			break;
