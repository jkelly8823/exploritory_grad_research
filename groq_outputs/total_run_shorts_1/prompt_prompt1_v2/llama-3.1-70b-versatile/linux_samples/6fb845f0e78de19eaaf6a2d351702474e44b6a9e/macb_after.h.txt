VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a C code snippet that defines several constants and two integer variables related to MACB (Media Access Controller for Backplane) capabilities and configurations. Additionally, there is a conditional compilation directive to define a constant GEM_TSEC_SIZE if CONFIG_MACB_USE_HWSTAMP is defined. The code snippet does not exhibit any vulnerable patterns such as buffer overflows, data type mismatches, or other security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
