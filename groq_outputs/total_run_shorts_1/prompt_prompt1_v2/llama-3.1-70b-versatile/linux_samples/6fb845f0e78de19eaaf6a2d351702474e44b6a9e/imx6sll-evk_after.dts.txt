VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability found
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be device configuration data for a U-Boot or Linux board file. It defines a set of properties for a device, including pinctrl, GPIO settings, power management, and regulator settings.

Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or other common issues.

The code uses what appears to be device tree definitions with bindings. The values set do not have any clear vulnerabilities. There is no use of commands like "eval" or functions calls that can allow arbitrary code execution.

This code does not appear to be handling any direct user input or processing untrusted data in an insecure manner.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
There is no need to make any changes as the provided code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to any security risks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	pinctrl-2 = <&pinctrl_usdhc3_200mhz>;
	cd-gpios = <&gpio3 22 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	keep-power-in-suspend;
	wakeup-source;
	vmmc-supply = <&reg_sd3_vmmc>;
	status = "okay";
