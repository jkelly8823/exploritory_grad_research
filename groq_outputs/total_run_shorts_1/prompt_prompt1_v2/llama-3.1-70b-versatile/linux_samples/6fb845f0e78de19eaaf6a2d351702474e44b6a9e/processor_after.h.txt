VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a series of macro definitions used for memory management in a kernel. The definitions seem to be based on page alignment and kernel task size, which are common practices in operating system development.

The code does not involve any external input, dynamic memory allocation, or pointer manipulation, which are common areas where vulnerabilities can be introduced. There are no obvious signs of buffer overflows, use of deprecated functions, or other known security risks.

Given the context of the code snippet, it seems to be a benign and properly designed code segment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as the code appears to be secure.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
* This decides where the kernel will search for a free chunk of vm
* space during mmap's.

#define TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE	PAGE_ALIGN(TASK_SIZE / 3)

#define STACK_TOP		TASK_SIZE
#define STACK_TOP_MAX		STACK_TOP
