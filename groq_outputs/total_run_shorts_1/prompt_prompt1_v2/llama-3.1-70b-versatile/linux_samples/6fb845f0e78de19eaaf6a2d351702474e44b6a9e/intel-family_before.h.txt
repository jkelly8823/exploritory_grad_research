VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a segment of C/C++ code that defines several constants for Intel processor families. The code does not contain any dynamic or user-controlled inputs that could lead to potential vulnerabilities. The definitions are static and do not involve any operations that could cause vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, data type misinterpretations, or memory corruptions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for this code.
ORIGINAL CODE:

 * "Big Core" Processors (Branded as Core, Xeon, etc...)
 *
 * The "_X" parts are generally the EP and EX Xeons, or the
 * "Extreme" ones, like Broadwell-E.
 *
 * While adding a new CPUID for a new microarchitecture, add a new
 * group to keep logically sorted out in chronological order. Within
 * that group keep the CPUID for the variants sorted by model number.
