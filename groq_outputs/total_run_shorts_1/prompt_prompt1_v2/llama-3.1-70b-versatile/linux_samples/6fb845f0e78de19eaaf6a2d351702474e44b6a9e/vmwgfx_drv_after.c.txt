VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Integer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow when setting DMA masks. Specifically, in the function `vmw_dma_masks()`, the line `ret = dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(64));` followed by the conditional `if (dev_priv->map_mode != vmw_dma_phys && (sizeof(unsigned long) == 4 || vmw_restrict_dma_mask))` may lead to an integer overflow when setting the mask for 64-bit and 44-bit systems. The reason for this is that `DMA_BIT_MASK(64)` and `DMA_BIT_MASK(44)` are bitmasks that could wrap around and result in an incorrect value, which might lead to the restriction being disabled unexpectedly.

However, the real issue is actually related to another piece of code that has been added which was not necessary for our check here. The call to `dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(44));` and `dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(64));` follows another potential bug here which allows for integer overflows indirectly. This however assumes knowledge that the call itself will attempt to write 64bits of data on all systems.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent integer overflows when setting DMA masks, you can handle the mask properly. For a 64-bit system, ensure that the maximum mask is set according to the `DMA_BIT_MASK` macro and restrict DMA addresses on systems that have smaller `sizeof(unsigned long)` types.

As this answer must align to recommendations, I've reviewed the problem description once more and established the need to handle writing data more finely. In summary, rather than writing using `dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(44))`, consider writing to it using `u64 restrictmask = DMA_BIT_MASK(44);` where sizeof is determined to ensure alignment.

Other possible suggestions would look like:

- Validate the value of `DMA_BIT_MASK(n)` for both limits to take 64 and 44.
- Since dma_set_mask_and_coherent already takes over uint64_t, try checking its code in the header or actual file to allow this call to be safe using as is.

However, you might want to consider potential performance impacts if necessary, and restrict masks might already work in such a way.


ORIGINAL CODE:
 static int vmw_dma_masks(struct vmw_private *dev_priv)
{
	struct drm_device *dev = dev_priv->dev;
	int ret = 0;

	ret = dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(64));
	if (dev_priv->map_mode != vmw_dma_phys &&
	    (sizeof(unsigned long) == 4 || vmw_restrict_dma_mask)) {
		DRM_INFO("Restricting DMA addresses to 44 bits.\n");
		return dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(44));
	}

	return ret;
}
