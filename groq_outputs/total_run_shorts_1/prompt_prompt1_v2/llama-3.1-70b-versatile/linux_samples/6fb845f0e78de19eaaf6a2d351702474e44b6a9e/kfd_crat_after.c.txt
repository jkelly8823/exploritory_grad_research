VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a function definition that appears to be part of a larger system, possibly a kernel driver or system program. It takes several parameters related to CPU configuration and resource allocation. 

The code is quite specific to a particular hardware architecture (x86_64) and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. There are no user input streams, network communications, or dynamically allocated memory that could be exploited. The function appears to be well-structured, but without the full context, it's difficult to analyze its security implications. However, within the given snippet, no vulnerabilities were found.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, there are no recommended fixes for this code.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return 0;
}

#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
static int kfd_fill_iolink_info_for_cpu(int numa_node_id, int *avail_size,
                uint32_t *num_entries,
                struct crat_subtype_iolink *sub_type_hdr)
