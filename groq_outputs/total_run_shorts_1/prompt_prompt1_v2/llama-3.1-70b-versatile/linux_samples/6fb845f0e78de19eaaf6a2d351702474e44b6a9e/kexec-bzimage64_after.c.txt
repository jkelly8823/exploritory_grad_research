VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found.

EXPLANATION:
Based on the provided code snippet, no vulnerabilities were detected. The code defines two pointers to `efi_info` structures and checks the availability of EFI runtime services. It also checks if the `efi_memmap_size` field is non-zero. The control flow is straightforward and does not reveal any obvious security weaknesses.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct efi_info *current_ei = &boot_params.efi_info;
struct efi_info *ei = &params->efi_info;

if (!efi_enabled(EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES))
        return 0;

if (!current_ei->efi_memmap_size)
        return 0;
