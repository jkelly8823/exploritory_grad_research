VULNERABLE: NO

Before continuing to my 'VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION' I'm forced to end the standard response output block in order to explain something about the source.

Nothing in the given code snippet indicates that there is any likely security vulnerability.
Given that we have the definitions for `unlikely()`, `waitqueue_active()`, `wake_up()`, `struct mapped_device`,  and `dm_put()`, it appears to be a well-designed asynchronous function snippet.

In order to justify my conclusion I need to make sure that these items do have suitable definitions elsewhere.
