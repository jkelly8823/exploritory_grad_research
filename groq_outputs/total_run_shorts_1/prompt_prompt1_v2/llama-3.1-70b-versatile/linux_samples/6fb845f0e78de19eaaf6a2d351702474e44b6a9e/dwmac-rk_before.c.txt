VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses pm_runtime_get_sync without checking the return value, which could lead to a resource leak if the function fails.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, pm_runtime_get_sync is called without checking its return value. This function is used to enable the runtime power management of a device and acquire a reference, preventing the device from being runtime suspended. If pm_runtime_get_sync fails and returns an error code, the function will continue executing, potentially causing the resource (i.e., the device) to leak. A resource leak occurs when a resource (e.g., memory, file descriptor) is allocated but not properly released, resulting in the resource becoming unavailable for future use.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, you should check the return value of pm_runtime_get_sync and handle any potential errors. Here is a possible fix:

```c
ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
if (ret) {
    // Error handling code here
    pm_runtime_put(dev);
    return ret;
}
```

In this example, if pm_runtime_get_sync fails, the error is handled, and pm_runtime_put is called to release the reference to prevent a resource leak.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	}

	ret = phy_power_on(bsp_priv, true);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

	pm_runtime_enable(dev);
	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
```
