VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of a potentially null pointer.

EXPLANATION:
The variable `p_fence` is used without a null check before being dereferenced to assign a value. If `p_fence` is null when the code attempts to assign `NULL` to the pointer it points to, a segmentation fault will occur. 

Without seeing more context or the function where `p_fence` is defined, it is unclear whether this is an intended behavior or a potential issue.

However, since the assignment occurs after the return statement, it can also be a syntax error in the given code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Firstly, verify that `p_fence` should indeed be used after the return statement. If it's supposed to be before, adjust the code accordingly.

Secondly, to prevent potential null pointer dereferences, ensure that `p_fence` is checked for null before it is dereferenced. Here's how to modify the code:
```c
if (p_fence) {
    *p_fence = NULL;
}
return ret;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
		*p_fence = NULL;
	}

	return ret;
}
