VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is related to CPU topology and SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) support. It checks if SMP is enabled and prints CPU information if not. This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities or potential issues.

However, note that we're only evaluating a code snippet and not the entire codebase. The function `print_cpu_info()` and `cpu_smt_check_topology_early()` are not defined in this snippet, and it's unknown how they handle input data or what potential paths could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SMP)` check is an internal kernel configuration macro and its condition should not cause any issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The provided code snippet is secure, but we recommend reviewing the functions `print_cpu_info()` and `cpu_smt_check_topology_early()` for any potential vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
* identify_boot_cpu() initialized SMT support information, let the
* core code know.
*/
cpu_smt_check_topology_early();

if (!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SMP)) {
    pr_info("CPU: ");
    print_cpu_info(&boot_cpu_data);
}
