VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack if the calculated buffer size exceeds the maximum allowed size for a `vmalloc` call, potentially causing memory corruption or a denial-of-service.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the `buf_size` is calculated by summing up the total size of the `initial_boot_params`, the length of the `cmdline` string, and `DTB_EXTRA_SPACE`. If this sum exceeds the maximum allowed size for a `vmalloc` call, calling `vmalloc` with this size may result in an error or undefined behavior. This can be exploited by an attacker who controls the input data (e.g., `cmdline`) to cause a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the calculated `buf_size` against the maximum allowed size for a `vmalloc` call before calling `vmalloc`. You can use the `PAGE_ALIGN()` or `round_up()` macros to ensure alignment. Additionally, instead of retrying indefinitely, consider adding a mechanism to handle the error and free any previously allocated resources.

```c
buf_size = fdt_totalsize(initial_boot_params)
		+ strlen(cmdline) + DTB_EXTRA_SPACE;
// Validate the buffer size
if (buf_size > VMALLOC_MAX_SIZE || buf_size > PAGE_ALIGN(buf_size)) {
	// Handle error, return or exit
}
for (;;) {
	buf = vmalloc(PAGE_ALIGN(buf_size));
	// ...
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
	void *buf;
	size_t buf_size;
	int ret;

	buf_size = fdt_totalsize(initial_boot_params)
			+ strlen(cmdline) + DTB_EXTRA_SPACE;

	for (;;) {
		buf = vmalloc(buf_size);
		if (!buf)
```
