VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5, 8, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential Deadlock and/or Starvation vulnerability exists due to busy waiting in a loop without proper synchronization.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a critical section of code as it is accessing and modifying shared resources. The code is using busy-waiting (spinlocks) to wait for certain conditions to be met. This is inherently non-deterministic and can lead to Deadlocks and/or Starvation if not properly synchronized.

Specifically, in lines 4-5 and 8-9, the code is busy-waiting in a loop on the same condition, which is not synchronized. This can cause multiple CPU cores to be stuck in the same loop indefinitely, leading to Deadlock. Furthermore, this non-deterministic behavior can lead to Starvation, where one or more CPU cores are unable to make progress due to other CPU cores holding onto shared resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement proper synchronization using mutex locks or semaphores to protect shared resources.
- Use event-driven programming to avoid busy waiting in loops.
- If the wait condition is expected to be short-lived, consider using a backoff strategy to reduce the likelihood of multiple CPU cores contending for the same shared resource.
