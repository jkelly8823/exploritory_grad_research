VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses a hard-coded value for the number of ports (B53_N_PORTS), but explicitly mentions that there is no port 6, which may indicate a potential off-by-one error or incorrect port indexing.

EXPLANATION:
The code iterates over the range of ports from 0 to B53_N_PORTS-1, but the comment suggests that there may be an issue with port 6, which could indicate that the loop may attempt to access an invalid or non-existent port index. This could lead to undefined behavior or errors when trying to access port_intrs[6].

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this potential vulnerability, it's recommended to explicitly define the correct number of ports and account for the missing port 6. This can be achieved by adjusting the loop condition to ensure that the iteration does not exceed the valid number of ports.

Example fix:
```c
for (i = 0; i < B53_N_PORTS - 1; i++) {
    port = &priv->port_intrs[i];
    // ...
}
```
Alternatively, you could define a separate constant or macro that represents the actual number of valid ports and use that in the loop condition.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/* Clear all pending interrupts */
	writel(0xffffffff, priv->regs + B53_SRAB_INTR);

for (i = 0; i < B53_N_PORTS; i++) {
   port = &priv->port_intrs[i];

   /* There is no port 6 */
```
