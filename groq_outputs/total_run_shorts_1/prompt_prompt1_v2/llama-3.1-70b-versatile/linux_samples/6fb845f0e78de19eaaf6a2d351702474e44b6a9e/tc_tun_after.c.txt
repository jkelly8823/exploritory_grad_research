VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `memcpy` to copy data from `n->primary_key` to `e->m_neigh.dst_ip`. However, the size of the data being copied is given by `n->tbl->key_len`, which may exceed the size of `e->m_neigh.dst_ip`. This could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing a segmentation fault or allowing an attacker to corrupt the memory and execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that `n->tbl->key_len` does not exceed the size of `e->m_neigh.dst_ip` before calling `memcpy`. This can be done by adding a check before the memcpy operation.
2. Consider using a safer function like `memmove` or `strncpy` instead of `memcpy` to avoid potential buffer overflow issues.
3. Validate the input data `n->primary_key` and `n->tbl->key_len` to ensure they are within expected limits.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
e->m_neigh.family = n->ops->family;
memcpy(&e->m_neigh.dst_ip, n->primary_key, n->tbl->key_len);
e->out_dev = out_dev;
e->route_dev = route_dev;

/* It's important to add the neigh to the hash table before checking
 * the neigh validity state. So if we'll get a notification, in case the
 * neigh changes it's validity state, we would find the relevant neigh
e->m_neigh.family = n->ops->family;
memcpy(&e->m_neigh.dst_ip, n->primary_key, n->tbl->key_len);
e->out_dev = out_dev;
e->route_dev = route_dev;

/* It's importent to add the neigh to the hash table before checking
 * the neigh validity state. So if we'll get a notification, in case the
 * neigh changes it's validity state, we would find the relevant neigh
