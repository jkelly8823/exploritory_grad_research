VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a memory management system, specifically deal with page directory entry management. It includes two functions, one is not clearly defined, but appears to relate to the memory footprint of a process, and another that is checking whether a given vm_area_struct is anonymous and pmd move must withdraw. The second function checks whether radix is enabled, and whether new_pmd_ptl is not equal to old_pmd_ptl and checks if the vma (virtual memory area) is anonymous.

No obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string issues, or command injection were identified in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Although no vulnerabilities were identified, it's always a good practice to consider defensive coding. The code snippet provided seems fine and does not have any obvious issues that would increase the risk of security vulnerabilities, but there are some aspects that are worth mentioning:

- Potential null pointer dereferences. While the checks for NULL pointers are good practice, they do not seem to be present here.
- Potential integer overflow issues. Although the code snippet does not directly show this issue, if the used types or variables are used elsewhere in the codebase, these issues might occur.
- Adding locking guards around variables shared between multiple threads like `direct_pages_count`. However since these are atomic operations they are thread safe.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
		   atomic_long_read(&direct_pages_count[MMU_PAGE_1G]) << 20);
}
#endif /* CONFIG_PROC_FS */

/*
 * For hash translation mode, we use the deposited table to store hash slot
 * information and they are stored at PTRS_PER_PMD offset from related pmd
 * location. Hence a pmd move requires deposit and withdraw.
 *
 * For radix translation with split pmd ptl, we store the deposited table in the
 * pmd page. Hence if we have different pmd page we need to withdraw during pmd
 * move.
 *
 * With hash we use deposited table always irrespective of anon or not.
 * With radix we use deposited table only for anonymous mapping.
