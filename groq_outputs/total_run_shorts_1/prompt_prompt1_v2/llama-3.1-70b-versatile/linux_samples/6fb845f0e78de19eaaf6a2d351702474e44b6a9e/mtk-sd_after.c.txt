VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential information leak vulnerability exists due to a debug logging statement that outputs potentially sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The debug logging statement on line 3 appears to output the `actual_clock` value from `host->mmc`. This could potentially disclose sensitive information about the internal clock speed, which could be useful to an attacker. It's also important to consider that debug logging might be left enabled in production environments, exacerbating the issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Filter sensitive information from debug logs.
- Disable debug logging in production environments.
- Ensure that sensitive information is not exposed through logging or other means.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	if (timing == MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS400 &&
	    host->dev_comp->hs400_tune)
		sdr_set_field(host->base + tune_reg,
			      MSDC_PAD_TUNE_CMDRRDLY,
			      host->hs400_cmd_int_delay);
	dev_dbg(host->dev, "sclk: %d, timing: %d\n", host->mmc->actual_clock,
		timing);
