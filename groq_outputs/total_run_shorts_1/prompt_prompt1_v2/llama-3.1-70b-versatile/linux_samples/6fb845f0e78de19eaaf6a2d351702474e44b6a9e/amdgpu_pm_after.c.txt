VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a Linux kernel device driver. It appears to be manipulating file permissions and checking the type of device, specifically for AMD APU devices. The code does not seem to have any obvious vulnerabilities in terms of user input handling, buffer overflows, or other security threats. The bit manipulation operation, comparisons, and function return appear to be safe and correct.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
effective_mode &= ~S_IWUSR;

if ((adev->flags & AMD_IS_APU) &&
    (attr == &sensor_dev_attr_power1_average.dev_attr.attr ||
     attr == &sensor_dev_attr_power1_cap_max.dev_attr.attr ||
     attr == &sensor_dev_attr_power1_cap_min.dev_attr.attr||
     attr == &sensor_dev_attr_power1_cap.dev_attr.attr))
    return 0;
