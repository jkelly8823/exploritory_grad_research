VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate input validation and potential integer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet does not properly validate the input values for `val` and `val2` before using them in arithmetic operations and assigning them to other variables. Specifically, the check `if (val2 != 0 || val < 0 || val > 20000)` does not prevent all possible integer overflows or underflows.

Moreover, the lack of validation on `val2` when it is used to assign a value to `mask` introduces a risk. 

Although it is not possible to trigger a buffer overflow with the given snippet, the inadequate validation and assignment can trigger other issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Validate and sanitize all input values to prevent potential integer overflows or underflows. 

Implement additional checks to ensure that `val` and `val2` are within expected ranges before performing arithmetic operations.

Ensure that when using `val2` to assign a value to `mask`, it is within the correct range for the type `long`.

Consider using safer arithmetic functions and types, such as `int64_t`, to prevent potential overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
case IIO_CHAN_INFO_SCALE:
	switch (chan->type) {
		case IIO_TEMP:
			*val = 1; /* 0.01 */
			*val2 = 100;
			break;
		case IIO_PH:
			*val = 1; /* 0.001 */
			*val2 = 1000;
			break;
			   int val, int val2, long mask)
{
	struct atlas_data *data = iio_priv(indio_dev);
	__be32 reg = cpu_to_be32(val);

	if (val2 != 0 || val < 0 || val > 20000)
		return -EINVAL;
