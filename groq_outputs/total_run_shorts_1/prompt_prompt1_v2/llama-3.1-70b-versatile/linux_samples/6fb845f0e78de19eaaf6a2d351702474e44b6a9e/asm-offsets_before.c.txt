VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be using a macro called `OFFSET` to define a set of offset values within a struct. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, command injections, or unprotected use of sensitive data. The macro seems to be simply assigning values to constants or variables, which does not present an immediate security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for security fixes are required in this case.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
OFFSET(TASK_STACK, task_struct, stack);
OFFSET(TASK_TI, task_struct, thread_info);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_FLAGS, task_struct, thread_info.flags);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_KERNEL_SP, task_struct, thread_info.kernel_sp);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_USER_SP, task_struct, thread_info.user_sp);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_CPU, task_struct, thread_info.cpu);
