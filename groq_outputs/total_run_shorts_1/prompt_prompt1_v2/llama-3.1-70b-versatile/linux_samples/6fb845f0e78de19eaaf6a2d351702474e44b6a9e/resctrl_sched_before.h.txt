VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a header file for the Intel Resource Control functionality on Linux. It includes necessary header files and defines a static inline function `resctrl_sched_in()`. The function is empty and does not perform any operations. There are no user inputs or data being processed that could lead to a security vulnerability. The code is mostly conditional compilation directives and function declaration.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary as no vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
#ifndef _ASM_X86_RESCTRL_SCHED_H
#define _ASM_X86_RESCTRL_SCHED_H

#ifdef CONFIG_X86_RESCTRL

#include <linux/sched.h>
#include <linux/jump_label.h>


static inline void resctrl_sched_in(void) {}

#endif /* CONFIG_X86_RESCTRL */

#endif /* _ASM_X86_RESCTRL_SCHED_H */
