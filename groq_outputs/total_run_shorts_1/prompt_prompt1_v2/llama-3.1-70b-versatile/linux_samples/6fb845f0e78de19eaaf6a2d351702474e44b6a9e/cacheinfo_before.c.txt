VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in property reading from 'of_property_read_u32()' function calls.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains two instances where 'of_property_read_u32()' function calls are made to read values from device tree properties. However, the property names ('size_prop' and 'nr_sets_prop') are not validated before being used to read the properties. This presents a potential security vulnerability since a malicious or compromised device tree could manipulate the property names to provide untrusted data, allowing an attacker to manipulate the values of 'this_leaf->size' and 'this_leaf->number_of_sets'.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the 'size_prop' and 'nr_sets_prop' property names before using them in the 'of_property_read_u32()' function calls. 
2. Use 'of_property_match_string()' to verify that the property names match the expected values before attempting to read them.
3. Consider additional error checking to handle cases where the property read fails, and potentially include logging or alerting mechanisms to notify of potential security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
ct_idx = get_cacheinfo_idx(this_leaf->type);
propname = cache_type_info[ct_idx].size_prop;

if (of_property_read_u32(np, propname, &this_leaf->size))
	this_leaf->size = 0;
}

/* not cache_line_size() because that's a macro in include/linux/cache.h */
static void cache_get_line_size(struct cacheinfo *this_leaf,
	ct_idx = get_cacheinfo_idx(this_leaf->type);
	propname = cache_type_info[ct_idx].nr_sets_prop;

	if (of_property_read_u32(np, propname, &this_leaf->number_of_sets))
		this_leaf->number_of_sets = 0;
}

static void cache_associativity(struct cacheinfo *this_leaf)
