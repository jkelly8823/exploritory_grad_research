VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Error Handling
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided introduces a scheduling operation for the kblockd work (`kblockd_schedule_work(&drive->rq_work)`) solely based on the return value of `ret`. However, this doesn't consider the potential context and consequences of doing so. This condition is checked after handling all pending requests in the queue. If there's an error when handling requests, it simply retries without any bounds on the condition. There's a chance that an infinite loop of work scheduling and error handling could occur if there's a problem that prevents requests from getting processed correctly, for instance, if all requests continuously return `ret != BLK_STS_OK`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To improve this error handling, a mechanism should be introduced to avoid circular scheduling. One possible approach could be to introduce a retry counter that prevents the kblockd work scheduling from entering an infinite loop. Additionally, if feasible, providing more informative error logging (with `ret` value and related request context) can help further troubleshoot the underlying problem.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
ide_drive_t *drive = container_of(work, ide_drive_t, rq_work);
ide_hwif_t *hwif = drive->hwif;
struct request *rq;
blk_status_t ret;
LIST_HEAD(list);

blk_mq_quiesce_queue(drive->queue);

ret = BLK_STS_OK;
spin_lock_irq(&hwif->lock);
while (!list_empty(&drive->rq_list)) {
    rq = list_first_entry(&drive->rq_list, struct request, queuelist);
    list_del_init(&rq->queuelist);

    spin_unlock_irq(&hwif->lock);
    ret = ide_issue_rq(drive, rq, true);
    spin_lock_irq(&hwif->lock);
}
spin_unlock_irq(&hwif->lock);

blk_mq_unquiesce_queue(drive->queue);

if (ret != BLK_STS_OK)
    kblockd_schedule_work(&drive->rq_work);
}
