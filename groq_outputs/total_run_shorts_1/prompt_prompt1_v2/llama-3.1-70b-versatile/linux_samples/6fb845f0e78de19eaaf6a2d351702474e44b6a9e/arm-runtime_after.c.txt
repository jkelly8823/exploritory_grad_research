VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a static structure initialization in C. It defines a structure `efi_ptdump_info` and initializes its members with literal values and pointers to other variables. After analyzing the code, no potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other security issues were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
static struct ptdump_info efi_ptdump_info = {
	.mm		= &efi_mm,
	.markers	= (struct addr_marker[]){
		{ 0,				"UEFI runtime start" },
		{ DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW_64,	"UEFI runtime end" },
		{ -1,				NULL }
	},
	.base_addr	= 0,
};
