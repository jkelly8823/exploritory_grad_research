VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No identified vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be defining offsets within a struct using a macro named `OFFSET`. The macro is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase, and is used to determine the offset of certain fields within the `task_struct` structure. 

The code snippet itself does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use of potentially insecure functions, or data validation issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations can be provided for this code snippet as it does not contain any identified vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
OFFSET(TASK_STACK, task_struct, stack);
OFFSET(TASK_TI, task_struct, thread_info);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_FLAGS, task_struct, thread_info.flags);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_PREEMPT_COUNT, task_struct, thread_info.preempt_count);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_KERNEL_SP, task_struct, thread_info.kernel_sp);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_USER_SP, task_struct, thread_info.user_sp);
OFFSET(TASK_TI_CPU, task_struct, thread_info.cpu);
