VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure GPIO pin configuration

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet sets a GPIO pin to active low using the line "cd-gpios = <&gpio CARD_6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;". However, it is set without explicitly disabling the wake-up functionality of the pin. This might inadvertently leave the system open to power-on or wake-up attacks through the GPIO pin.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Verify if the wake-up functionality of the pin is indeed intended to be active low. If not, explicitly set the pin wake-up functionality to disabled when in a powered-off or sleep state.

```c
cd-gpios = <&gpio CARD_6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
cd-wakeup = <0>; // Add this line or set it according to your board requirements
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	cap-sd-highspeed;
	disable-wp;

	cd-gpios = <&gpio CARD_6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

	vmmc-supply = <&vcc_3v3>;
};
```
