VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
I have analyzed the provided code snippet and did not identify any obvious vulnerabilities. The code defines a static struct `ptdump_info` and initializes its members with values. The initialization does not involve any user input, pointer arithmetic, or other operations that could potentially lead to a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static struct ptdump_info efi_ptdump_info = {
	.mm		= &efi_mm,
	.markers	= (struct addr_marker[]){
		{ 0,		"UEFI runtime start" },
		{ DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW_64, "UEFI runtime end" }
	},
	.base_addr	= 0,
};
```
