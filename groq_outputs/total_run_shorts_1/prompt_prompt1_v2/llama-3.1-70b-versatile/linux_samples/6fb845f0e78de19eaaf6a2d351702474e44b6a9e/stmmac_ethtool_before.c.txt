VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippets provided contain potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. The lines in question involve the division of two `unsigned long` integers and the multiplication of variables. The overflow occurs when the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `unsigned long` integer.

In the first code snippet, the expression `(usec * (clk / 1000000))` can cause an overflow when the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `unsigned long`. Similarly, in the second code snippet, the expression `(riwt * 256)` can cause an overflow when the result exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `unsigned long`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, consider using a larger integer type, such as `uint64_t`, to store the result of the multiplication. Additionally, consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the result of the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in the chosen integer type.

For example:

```c
uint64_t result = (uint64_t)usec * (uint64_t)(clk / 1000000);
return result / 256;

// ...

uint64_t result = (uint64_t)riwt * 256;
return result / (clk / 1000000);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
	unsigned long clk = clk_get_rate(priv->plat->stmmac_clk);

	if (!clk)
		return 0;

	return (usec * (clk / 1000000)) / 256;
}

{
	unsigned long clk = clk_get_rate(priv->plat->stmmac_clk);

	if (!clk)
		return 0;

	return (riwt * 256) / (clk / 1000000);
}
```
