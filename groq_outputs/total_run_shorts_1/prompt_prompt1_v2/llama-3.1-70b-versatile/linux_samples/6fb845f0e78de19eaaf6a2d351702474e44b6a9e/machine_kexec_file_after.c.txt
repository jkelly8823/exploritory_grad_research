VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential out-of-memory denial-of-service vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to a potential out-of-memory condition. The `vmalloc` function is used to allocate memory of `buf_size` bytes. However, if the system runs out of memory, `vmalloc` returns `NULL` and the loop continues indefinitely, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to add a check to prevent an infinite loop in case the memory allocation fails. For example:

```c
if (!buf) {
    // handle the out-of-memory condition
    // e.g., log an error, return an error code, or terminate the program
    // ...
    break;
}
```

Additionally, consider using a more robust memory allocation mechanism that can handle out-of-memory conditions, or implementing memory quotas to prevent a single allocation from exhausting the system's resources.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
    void *buf;
    size_t buf_size;
    size_t cmdline_len;
    int ret;

    cmdline_len = cmdline ? strlen(cmdline) : 0;
    buf_size = fdt_totalsize(initial_boot_params)
            + cmdline_len + DTB_EXTRA_SPACE;

    for (;;) {
        buf = vmalloc(buf_size);
        if (!buf)
```
