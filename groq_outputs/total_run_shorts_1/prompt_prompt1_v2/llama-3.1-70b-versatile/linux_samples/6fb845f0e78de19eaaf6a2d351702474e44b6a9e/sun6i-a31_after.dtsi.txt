VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a device tree configuration for a fixed clock and a 32 kHz clock. The code defines properties for the clock devices such as clock cells, compatibility, frequency, and output names. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The properties are properly defined, and there are no obvious issues with syntax or security.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as there are no detected vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			clock-frequency = <24000000>;
			clock-output-names = "osc24M";
		};

		osc32k: clk-32k {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
