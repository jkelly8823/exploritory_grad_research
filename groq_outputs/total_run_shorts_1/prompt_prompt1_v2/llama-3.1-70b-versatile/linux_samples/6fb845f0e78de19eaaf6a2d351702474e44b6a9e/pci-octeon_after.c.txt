ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (octeon_has_feature(OCTEON_FEATURE_PCIE))
	return 0;

if (!octeon_is_pci_host()) {
	pr_notice("Not in host mode, PCI Controller not initialized\n");
	return 0;
}

/* Point pcibios_map_irq() to the PCI version of it */
octeon_pcibios_map_irq = octeon_pci_pcibios_map_irq;

/* Only use the big bars on chips that support it */
else
	octeon_dma_bar_type = OCTEON_DMA_BAR_TYPE_BIG;

/* PCI I/O and PCI MEM values */
set_io_port_base(OCTEON_PCI_IOSPACE_BASE);
ioport_resource.start = 0;
ioport_resource.end = OCTEON_PCI_IOSPACE_SIZE - 1;
