VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Input validation issue due to lack of sufficient error checking.

EXPLANATION:
The input validation implemented in the provided code snippet only checks for specific conditions. However, it does not check for potential overflows that might occur when dividing 'val' by 10 in the line `__be32 reg = cpu_to_be32(val / 10);`. If 'val' is close to the maximum value for an 'int' data type and has a remainder of less than 10, it would be accepted as valid input but can still cause an integer overflow when divided by 10.

Additionally, though the input value 'val' is validated for values below -1 or above 20000, the issue does not consider under/overflow conditions that might occur due to the cast to `__be32` type or during the division operation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add overflow checking when performing the division operation to prevent potential overflows.
- Implement under/overflow checks for 'val' values that are close to the maximum int value.

```c
if ((val > INT_MAX / 10) || (val2 != 0 || val < 0 || val > 20000))
    return -EINVAL;
```
Also, if `val` should not be negative and the integer division by zero issue still needs to be addressed. Ensure safe type casting from int to __be32.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
    case IIO_CHAN_INFO_SCALE:
        switch (chan->type) {
        case IIO_TEMP:
            *val = 10;
            return IIO_VAL_INT;
        case IIO_PH:
            *val = 1; /* 0.001 */
            *val2 = 1000;
            break;
            int val, int val2, long mask)
{
        struct atlas_data *data = iio_priv(indio_dev);
        __be32 reg = cpu_to_be32(val / 10);

        if (val2 != 0 || val < 0 || val > 20000)
            return -EINVAL;
```
