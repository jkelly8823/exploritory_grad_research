VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be function prototypes and defines, which on their own do not pose a direct security risk. There are no apparent issues with input validation, buffer handling, or potential memory corruption.
However, without the full context of how these functions are implemented, it is difficult to say for certain that they do not introduce any vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to analyze the complete function bodies to ensure they handle potential input and internal states correctly. Additionally, review of the functions' usage within the larger codebase could provide further insights.
