VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be function declarations and does not contain any implementation. It is not possible to introduce vulnerabilities in this snippet as it does not perform any operations. The code is a header interface that defines the functions that will be implemented elsewhere. No security issues can be determined from function prototypes alone.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. No recommendations are necessary as the code is not vulnerable.
