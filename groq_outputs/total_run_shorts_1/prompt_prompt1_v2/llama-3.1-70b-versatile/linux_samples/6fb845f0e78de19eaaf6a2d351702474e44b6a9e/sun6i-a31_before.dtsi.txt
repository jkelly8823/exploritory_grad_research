VULNERABLE: NO

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
None

EXPLANATION:
This segment of code appears to be a configuration file in device tree syntax (dT). The code snippet is declaring two clock nodes with device tree properties such as '#clock-cells', 'compatible', and 'clock-frequency'. These properties seem to be correctly defined and there are no indications of any security vulnerabilities in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			clock-frequency = <24000000>;
		};

		osc32k: clk-32k {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
