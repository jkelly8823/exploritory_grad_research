VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a collection of CPUID definitions for various Intel processor families. It defines multiple constants for different processor models using the `#define` directive. There is no apparent vulnerability in this code, as it is simply a set of preprocessor definitions. These definitions do not involve input validation, buffer management, or other common sources of vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were detected in the code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 * "Big Core" Processors (Branded as Core, Xeon, etc...)
 *
 * The "_X" parts are generally the EP and EX Xeons, or the
 * "Extreme" ones, like Broadwell-E, or Atom microserver.
 *
 * While adding a new CPUID for a new microarchitecture, add a new
 * group to keep logically sorted out in chronological order. Within
 * that group keep the CPUID for the variants sorted by model number.
