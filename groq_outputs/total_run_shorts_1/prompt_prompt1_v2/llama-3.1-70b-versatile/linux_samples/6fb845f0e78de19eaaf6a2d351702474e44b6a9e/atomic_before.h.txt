VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Multiple instances of inline assembly code vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet uses inline assembly (`__asm__ __volatile__`) with raw strings, which can be vulnerable to command injection attacks. This is particularly concerning as the inline assembly uses registers that are not sanitized or validated. 

Moreover, the use of `__asm__ __volatile__` also raises concerns about potential buffer overflow or buffer corruption vulnerabilities, as there is a potential for data corruption when mixing assembly and high-level languages.

The repeated code snippets also introduce issues of code duplication, making it difficult to maintain and troubleshoot the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of using raw inline assembly, consider using higher-level abstractions or compiler intrinsics, which can provide similar functionality but with better security guarantees.
- Validate and sanitize any input values before using them in the assembly code.
- Use defensive programming techniques to mitigate potential buffer overflows or corruptions.
- Consider refactoring the code to eliminate repetition.
