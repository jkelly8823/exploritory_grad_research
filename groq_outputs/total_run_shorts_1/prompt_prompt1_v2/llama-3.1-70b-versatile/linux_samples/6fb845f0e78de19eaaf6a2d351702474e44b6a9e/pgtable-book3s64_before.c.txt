VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be using an atomic operation to read a value from an array. The expression `atomic_long_read(&direct_pages_count[MMU_PAGE_1G])` suggests that the code is accessing a shared variable in a thread-safe manner. The use of atomic operations is a good practice for synchronization. The code does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required. The code appears to be properly synchronized.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
atomic_long_read(&direct_pages_count[MMU_PAGE_1G]) << 20);
}
#endif /* CONFIG_PROC_FS */
```
