VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No apparent vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of C code that handles device initialization and power management. It checks for potential error conditions from the `phy_power_on` function, properly cleans up by disabling the GMAC clock and returning the error, and then attempts to enable and acquire a runtime power management session. Without knowledge of the specific functions and their implementations, this code does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities such as potential for buffer overflow, use of unchecked user input, or improper error handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet, no changes are recommended.
ORIGINAL CODE:

		return ret;

	pm_runtime_enable(dev);
	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
