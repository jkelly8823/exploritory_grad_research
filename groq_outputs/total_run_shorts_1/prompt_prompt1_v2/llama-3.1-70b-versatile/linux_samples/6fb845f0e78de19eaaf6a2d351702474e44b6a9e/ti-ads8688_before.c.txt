VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential out-of-bounds array access in the buffer array.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a for loop that runs up to 'indio_dev->masklength', which is then used as an index for an array 'buffer' with a fixed size of 8. However, this could result in an out-of-bounds array access if 'indio_dev->masklength' is greater than or equal to 8. This can cause undefined behavior, including crashes, data corruption, or potentially even security exploits.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the loop index does not exceed the array size. This can be done by:

* Either changing the loop condition to 'i < 8' if the intention is to iterate only over the array.
* Or changing the size of the 'buffer' array to be dynamically allocated based on the size of 'indio_dev->masklength'.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define ADS8688_VREF_MV			4096
#define ADS8688_REALBITS		16

/*
 * enum ads8688_range - ADS8688 reference voltage range
 * @ADS8688_PLUSMINUS25VREF: Device is configured for input range Â±2.5 * VREF
{
	struct iio_poll_func *pf = p;
	struct iio_dev *indio_dev = pf->indio_dev;
	u16 buffer[8];
	int i, j = 0;

	for (i = 0; i < indio_dev->masklength; i++) {
		if (!test_bit(i, indio_dev->active_scan_mask))
