VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No detectable vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a switch statement in C, where the code selects a value for `pclk_vol_table` based on the value of a variable (possibly an enum). The code seems to follow standard practices and does not exhibit any obvious vulnerability patterns such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or buffer overflows.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	break;
	case amd_pp_dpp_clock:
		pclk_vol_table = pinfo->vdd_dep_on_dppclk;
		break;
	default:
		return -EINVAL;
	}
```
