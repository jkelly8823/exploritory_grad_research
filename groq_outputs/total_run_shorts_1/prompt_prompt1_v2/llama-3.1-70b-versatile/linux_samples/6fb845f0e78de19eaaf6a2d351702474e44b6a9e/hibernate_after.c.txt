VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were identified in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a kernel-level crash handling mechanism, specifically dealing with cache cleaning and crash dump kernel image protection. The functions `dcache_clean_range` and `el2_reset_needed` are likely intended to clean the cache and check for reset needs, respectively. The `crash_post_resume` function is used to protect the crash dump kernel image. The logic and function calls in the given code snippet do not raise any alarms regarding potential vulnerabilities. It is worth noting that the lack of context (e.g., variable declarations and definitions) might mask potential vulnerabilities, but within the provided code snippet, no issues are evident.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
dcache_clean_range(__idmap_text_start, __idmap_text_end);

/* Clean kvm setup code to PoC? */
if (el2_reset_needed()) {
    dcache_clean_range(__hyp_idmap_text_start, __hyp_idmap_text_end);
    dcache_clean_range(__hyp_text_start, __hyp_text_end);
}

/* make the crash dump kernel image protected again */
crash_post_resume();
```
