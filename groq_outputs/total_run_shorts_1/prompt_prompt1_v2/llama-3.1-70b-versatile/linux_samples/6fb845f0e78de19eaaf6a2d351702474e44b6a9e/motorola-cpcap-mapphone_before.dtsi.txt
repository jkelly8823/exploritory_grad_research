VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No security vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a configuration snippet, likely for a USB controller or a hardware device. It defines two properties: `interrupts-extended` and `interrupt-names`. The `interrupts-extended` property defines a list of interrupt numbers and flags, while the `interrupt-names` property defines a list of names for these interrupts. No obvious security vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet. The configuration is self-contained and does not appear to allow for any form of code execution or data manipulation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for security fixes are provided, as no security vulnerabilities were found.
