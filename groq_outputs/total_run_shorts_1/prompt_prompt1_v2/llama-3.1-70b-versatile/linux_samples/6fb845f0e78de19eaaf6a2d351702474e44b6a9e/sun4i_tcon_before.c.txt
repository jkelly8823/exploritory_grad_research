VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Resource Leak vulnerability due to potential failure to free resources in case of an error.

EXPLANATION: 
The code checks if `tcon->sclk1` is in an error state and returns early if it is. However, `tcon->sclk0` is not checked for an error state after calling `PTR_ERR(tcon->sclk0)`. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where `tcon->sclk1` is successfully acquired but then an error occurs later on. In such a case, the `tcon->sclk1` resource remains allocated and is not freed, leading to a resource leak.

However, since this snippet appears to be part of a larger codebase, it's also possible that the `sun4i_tcon_free_clocks` function, which is called elsewhere in the code, is responsible for freeing these resources. Nevertheless, to ensure resource safety, the freeing of `tcon->sclk1` should be handled in the current function as well.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add error checking and resource freeing code after acquiring `tcon->sclk1`:
```c
if (tcon->quirks->has_channel_1) {
	tcon->sclk1 = devm_clk_get(dev, "tcon-ch1");
	if (IS_ERR(tcon->sclk1)) {
		clk_put(tcon->sclk0); // Free tcon->sclk0 if sclk1 fails
		err = PTR_ERR(tcon->sclk1);
	}
}
```
This ensures that `tcon->sclk0` and `tcon->sclk1` resources are properly freed when an error occurs.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
		return PTR_ERR(tcon->sclk0);
	}
}

	if (tcon->quirks->has_channel_1) {
		tcon->sclk1 = devm_clk_get(dev, "tcon-ch1");
		if (IS_ERR(tcon->sclk1)) {

{
	clk_disable_unprepare(tcon->clk);
}
