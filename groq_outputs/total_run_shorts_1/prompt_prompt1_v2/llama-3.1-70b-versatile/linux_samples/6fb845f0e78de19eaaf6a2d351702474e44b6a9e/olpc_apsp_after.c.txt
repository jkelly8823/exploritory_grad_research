VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to missing free in error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is attempting to allocate memory for a serio structure using kzalloc. However, if the allocation fails, the function returns -ENOMEM without freeing any previously allocated resources. This can lead to a resource leak, as the previously allocated resources are not released.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
In the event of an error, it's essential to free any previously allocated resources to prevent resource leaks. Since the code snippet is only allocating a single resource (kb_serio), it's relatively straightforward to address this issue. You can add code to free kb_serio before returning -ENOMEM. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int olpc_apsp_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
	if (priv->irq < 0)
		return priv->irq;

	/* KEYBOARD */
	kb_serio = kzalloc(sizeof(struct serio), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!kb_serio)
		return -ENOMEM;
```
