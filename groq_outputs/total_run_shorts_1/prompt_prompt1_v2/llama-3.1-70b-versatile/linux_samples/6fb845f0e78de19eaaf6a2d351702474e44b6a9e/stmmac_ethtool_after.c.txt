VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-16 (both blocks)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Division By Zero vulnerability is present.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains two blocks that perform a similar operation: retrieving a clock rate and performing a calculation based on that rate. However, there is no check to ensure that the divisor in the calculation is non-zero before performing the division. If the `clk` value is zero (which can happen if `clk_get_rate(priv->plat->stmmac_clk)` and `priv->plat->clk_ref_rate` are both zero), the code will attempt to divide by zero, leading to undefined behavior.

Additionally, there is a lack of error handling in case the division overflows or underflows.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should check to ensure the divisor is non-zero before performing the division:

```c
unsigned long clk = clk_get_rate(priv->plat->stmmac_clk);
if (clk) {
    // ... use clk ...
} else {
    clk = priv->plat->clk_ref_rate;
    if (clk) {
        // ... use clk ...
    } else {
        // Handle error: unable to retrieve valid clock rate
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Additionally, we can prevent division overflows by casting the result of the multiplication to a larger type before dividing:

```c
return ((usec * (clk / 1000000L)) / 256);
return ((riwt * 256) / (clk / 1000000L));
```

Here, the `L` suffix casts the literal `1000000` to a `long`, preventing overflow when performing the division.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
{
    unsigned long clk = clk_get_rate(priv->plat->stmmac_clk);

    if (!clk) {
        clk = priv->plat->clk_ref_rate;
        if (!clk)
            return 0;
    }

    return (usec * (clk / 1000000)) / 256;
}

{
    unsigned long clk = clk_get_rate(priv->plat->stmmac_clk);

    if (!clk) {
        clk = priv->plat->clk_ref_rate;
        if (!clk)
            return 0;
    }

    return (riwt * 256) / (clk / 1000000);
}
```
