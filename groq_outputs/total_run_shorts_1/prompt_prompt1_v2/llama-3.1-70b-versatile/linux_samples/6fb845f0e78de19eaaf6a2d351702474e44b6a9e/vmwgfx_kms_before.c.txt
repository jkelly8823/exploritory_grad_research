VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of Variable That Has Not Been Checked For Null
EXPLANATION:
The variable `ctx` is used in the line `vmw_validation_has_bos(ctx)`, but there is no prior check to ensure that `ctx` is not null. If `ctx` is null, this will result in a null-pointer dereference, potentially leading to a crash or security vulnerability.

Additionally, the function `vmw_execbuf_fence_commands` is also called with pointers `file_priv` and `dev_priv` that are not checked for null within the provided snippet.

There are other potential vulnerabilities with function calls and pointer dereferences, but given the limited code and missing variable declarations, the risk associated with using `ctx` and potentially `file_priv` and `dev_priv` cannot be ignored.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this vulnerability, the code should check whether `ctx`, `file_priv`, and `dev_priv` are null before using them. This can be achieved by adding a null check before calling functions with these pointers.

```
if (ctx != NULL) {
    ret = vmw_execbuf_fence_commands(file_priv, dev_priv, &fence, ...);
} else {
    ret = -EINVAL;
    goto clean;
}
```
 
Preferably the same steps should also be taken for `file_priv` and `dev_priv`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct drm_connector_state *conn_state;
struct vmw_connector_state *vmw_conn_state;

if (!du->pref_active) {
    ret = -EINVAL;
    goto clean;
}

              user_fence_rep)
{
    struct vmw_fence_obj *fence = NULL;
    uint32_t handle;
    int ret;

    if (file_priv || user_fence_rep || vmw_validation_has_bos(ctx) ||
        out_fence)
        ret = vmw_execbuf_fence_commands(file_priv, dev_priv, &fence,
