VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is a segment of a hardware description file, likely in the Device Tree Source (DTS) format, which is used to describe the hardware components of an embedded system. The snippet does not contain any execution logic, input validation, or sensitive data handling that could be exploited for a security vulnerability. It only contains a few configuration lines for a GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pin and an MMC (MultiMedia Card) device.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it does not pose any known security risks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
/* For debugging, it is often good idea to remove this GPIO.
   It means you can remove back cover (to reboot by removing
   battery) and still use the MMC card. */
cd-gpios = <&gpio6 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* 160 */
};

/* most boards use vaux3, only some old versions use vmmc2 instead */
&mmc2 {
