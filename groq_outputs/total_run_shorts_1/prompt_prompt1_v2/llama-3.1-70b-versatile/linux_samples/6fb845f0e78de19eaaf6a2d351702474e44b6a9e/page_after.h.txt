VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of a low-level programming language (likely assembly or a kernel module) and defines macros for working with page tables. The macros seem to be designed for handling different architectures (32-bit vs 64-bit) and correctly handle the resulting size difference in page table entries.

The macros `__pgd(x)` and `__pgprot(x)` are properly wrapped to ensure correct casting to `pgd_t` and `pgprot_t` types, respectively.

There is also a conditional definition of `PTE_FMT`, a string format for printf-style functions, which correctly handles the difference in size between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

There are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
As there are no vulnerabilities identified in this snippet, no recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
#define __pgd(x)	((pgd_t) { (x) })
#define __pgprot(x)	((pgprot_t) { (x) })

#ifdef CONFIG_64BIT
#define PTE_FMT "%016lx"
#else
#define PTE_FMT "%08lx"
#endif
```
