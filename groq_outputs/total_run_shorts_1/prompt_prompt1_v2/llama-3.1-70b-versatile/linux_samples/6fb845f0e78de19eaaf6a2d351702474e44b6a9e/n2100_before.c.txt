VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Magic number vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The line of code using the magic number '1' without explanation or context can make it difficult for other developers to understand the purpose of this piece of code. This makes maintainability more difficult. Furthermore, requiring a comment or constant can reduce errors in similar checks throughout the code base.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Define the magic number as a constant to improve code clarity and maintainability.

```c
#define N2100_PCI_MAP_IRQ_SLOT 1

static int __init
n2100_pci_map_irq(const struct pci_dev *dev, u8 slot, u8 pin)
{
    int irq;

    if (PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn) == N2100_PCI_MAP_IRQ_SLOT) {
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/*
 * N2100 PCI.
 */
static int __init
n2100_pci_map_irq(const struct pci_dev *dev, u8 slot, u8 pin)
{
    int irq;

    if (PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn) == 1) {
```
