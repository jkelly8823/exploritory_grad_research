No evident vulnerabilities or insecure practices were detected in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	power {
		label = "Power Button";
		gpios = <&gpio2 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		gpio-key,wakeup;
		linux,code = <KEY_POWER>;
	};
	};
```
Note: Without the full context and understanding of the system, this evaluation might not cover all potential risks or implications. However, based on the given snippet, no evident vulnerabilities are present.
