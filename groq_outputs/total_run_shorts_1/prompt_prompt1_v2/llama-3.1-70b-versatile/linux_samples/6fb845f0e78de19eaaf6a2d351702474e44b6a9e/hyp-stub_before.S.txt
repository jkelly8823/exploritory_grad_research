VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of low-level system code, likely for an ARM-based system. It defines an entry point for a set of hypervisor stub vectors. The code defines the entry point `__hyp_stub_vectors` and a single vector `el2_sync_invalid` for handling synchronous EL2t events.

The code does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use of deprecated functions, or insecure memory management practices. The use of a fixed alignment directive (`align 11`) and the explicit definition of the text segment (`text`) suggest that the code is being carefully managed to ensure proper memory layout.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <asm/virt.h>

    .text
    .align 11

ENTRY(__hyp_stub_vectors)
    ventry    el2_sync_invalid    // Synchronous EL2t
```
