VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an ext4 file system implementation, specifically dealing with extent headers. The code defines two preprocessor macros: `EXT4_EXT_MAGIC` and `EXT4_EXTENT_TAIL_OFFSET`. The `EXT4_EXT_MAGIC` macro is a simple constant definition, while `EXT4_EXTENT_TAIL_OFFSET` is a macro that calculates an offset value based on the size of certain structures and a header value.

No potential security vulnerabilities or issues have been identified in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
};

#define EXT4_EXT_MAGIC	cpu_to_le16(0xf30a)

#define EXT4_EXTENT_TAIL_OFFSET(hdr) \
	(sizeof(struct ext4_extent_header) + \
	 (sizeof(struct ext4_extent) * le16_to_cpu((hdr)->eh_max)))
```
