VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It defines several variables for tracking system state (locked shared memory, Unix sockets in flight, and keyrings) but does not contain any logic that could potentially be exploited. The variables are properly declared, and no input or data processing is performed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
#endif
<unsigned long locked_shm; /* How many pages of mlocked shm ? */
(unsigned long unix_inflight;  /* How many files in flight in unix sockets */

#ifdef CONFIG_KEYS
(struct key *uid_keyring; /* UID specific keyring */
(struct key *session_keyring; /* UID's default session keyring */
