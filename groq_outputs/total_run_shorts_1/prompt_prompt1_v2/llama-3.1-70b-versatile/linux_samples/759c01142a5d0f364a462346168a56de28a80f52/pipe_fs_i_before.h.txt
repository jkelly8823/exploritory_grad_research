VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No apparent vulnerability detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a struct for pipe inode information and some function prototypes. The struct contains mutex locks and wait queues, which are necessary for synchronization. However, there's no apparent vulnerability or insecurity present in the code. This may be because the actual usage of the structs and functions is not provided in the snippet, but within the confines of this code, everything seems secure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities or potential issues were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
 *	@fasync_readers: reader side fasync
 *	@fasync_writers: writer side fasync
 *	@bufs: the circular array of pipe buffers
 **/
struct pipe_inode_info {
	struct mutex mutex;
	wait_queue_head_t wait;
	struct fasync_struct *fasync_readers;
	struct fasync_struct *fasync_writers;
	struct pipe_buffer *bufs;
};

/*
 * Note on the nesting of these functions:
void pipe_double_lock(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_inode_info *);

extern unsigned int pipe_max_size, pipe_min_size;
