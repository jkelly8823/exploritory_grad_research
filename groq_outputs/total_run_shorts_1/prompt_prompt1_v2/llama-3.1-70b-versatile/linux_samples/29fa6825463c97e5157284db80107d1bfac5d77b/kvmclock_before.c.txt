VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Incomplete Mediation of Physical Resource Usage
EXPLANATION:
The `clocksource_register_hz` function call is vulnerable because it does not validate or check for errors after registering the clocksource. It can lead to potential Denial of Service (DoS) if an attacker can manipulate the clocksource. This is exacerbated by the function's lack of authorization when selecting a clocksource.
However, more context is necessary to confirm the vulnerability.
In this snippet alone I am issuing this result due to incomplete mediation on PHYSICAL RESOURCES. Specifically: Time.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement proper error handling and validation after registering the clocksource using the `clocksource_register_hz` function. Verify that the returned value from this function call is valid and not null. In addition, ensure proper validation of the input arguments to this function. Implement authorization to ensure that only authorized components can affect the clocksource.
