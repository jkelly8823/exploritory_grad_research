VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Infinite loop vulnerability due to incorrect handling of error conditions.

EXPLANATION:
The `kvm_pin_pages` function appears to be attempting to recursively pin pages in memory. However, the function does not properly handle error conditions. Specifically, if `is_error_noslot_pfn(pfn)` returns true, the function should terminate or handle the error condition, but instead, it simply increments `gfn` and continues to the next iteration, potentially leading to an infinite loop. Additionally, if the recursive call to `kvm_pin_pages` fails, the function will also increment `gfn` and continue, potentially causing an infinite loop.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the function should properly handle error conditions. This can be achieved by:

* Returning an error code or terminating the function if `is_error_noslot_pfn(pfn)` returns true.
* Properly handling the error condition when the recursive call to `kvm_pin_pages` fails. This could involve terminating the function or attempting to recover from the error.
* Ensuring that the `gfn` variable is not incremented in error conditions, as this could lead to an infinite loop.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
static pfn_t kvm_pin_pages(struct kvm_memory_slot *slot, gfn_t gfn,
			   unsigned long size)
{
	gfn_t end_gfn;
	pfn_t pfn;

	pfn     = gfn_to_pfn_memslot(slot, gfn);
	end_gfn = gfn + (size >> PAGE_SHIFT);
	gfn    += 1;

	if (is_error_noslot_pfn(pfn))
		return pfn;
		 * Pin all pages we are about to map in memory. This is
		 * important because we unmap and unpin in 4kb steps later.
		 */
		pfn = kvm_pin_pages(slot, gfn, page_size);
		if (is_error_noslot_pfn(pfn)) {
			gfn += 1;
			continue;
		}
		if (r) {
			printk(KERN_ERR "kvm_iommu_map_address:"
			       "iommu failed to map pfn=%llx\n", pfn);
			kvm_unpin_pages(kvm, pfn, page_size);
			goto unmap_pages;
		}

		gfn += page_size >> PAGE_SHIFT;
