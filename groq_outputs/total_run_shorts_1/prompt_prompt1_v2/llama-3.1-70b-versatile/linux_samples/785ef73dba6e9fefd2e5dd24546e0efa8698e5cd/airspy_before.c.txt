ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (ret) {
	dev_err(s->dev, "Failed to register as video device (%d)\n",
			ret);
	goto err_unregister_v4l2_dev;
}
dev_info(s->dev, "Registered as %s\n",
		video_device_node_name(&s->vdev));
dev_notice(s->dev, "SDR API is still slightly experimental and functionality changes may follow\n");
