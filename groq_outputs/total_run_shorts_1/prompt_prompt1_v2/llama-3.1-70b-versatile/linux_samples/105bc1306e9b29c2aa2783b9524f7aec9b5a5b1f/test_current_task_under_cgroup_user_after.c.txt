VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is an excerpt from what appears to be a C program that utilizes the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and cgroup helpers. The code includes necessary headers and defines a constant CGROUP_PATH. There are no dynamic inputs, function calls, or pointer operations that could potentially lead to a vulnerability. The code snippet appears to be setting up for potential future operations but does not contain any immediate vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for this code snippet, as no vulnerabilities were identified.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <bpf/bpf.h>
#include "bpf_load.h"
#include "cgroup_helpers.h"

#define CGROUP_PATH		"/my-cgroup"
