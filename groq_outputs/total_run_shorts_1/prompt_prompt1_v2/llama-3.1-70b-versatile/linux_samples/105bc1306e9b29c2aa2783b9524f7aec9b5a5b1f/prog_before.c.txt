VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of two main components: an array initialization and a function declaration. Both components do not show any signs of potential vulnerabilities. The array initialization appears to be part of a larger enum or struct definition, but it does not contain any code that can be exploited. The function declaration is also harmless. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
