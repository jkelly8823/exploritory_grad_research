VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
After analyzing the code snippet, I did not find any apparent vulnerabilities. The code appears to be defining a series of symbolic constants for BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) program types and a function prototype. The print_boot_time function seems to take a 64-bit unsigned integer representing nanoseconds, a character buffer, and the size of the buffer as arguments. There is no executable code in this function, only a declaration. Therefore, I could not find any potential security risks in this isolated code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as I did not find any vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
[BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT]	= "raw_tracepoint",
[BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR] = "cgroup_sock_addr",
[BPF_PROG_TYPE_LIRC_MODE2]	= "lirc_mode2",
[BPF_PROG_TYPE_FLOW_DISSECTOR]	= "flow_dissector",
};

static void print_boot_time(__u64 nsecs, char *buf, unsigned int size)
