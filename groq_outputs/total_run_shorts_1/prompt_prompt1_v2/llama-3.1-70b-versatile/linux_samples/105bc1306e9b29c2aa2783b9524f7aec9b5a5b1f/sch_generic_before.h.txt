VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains C code that defines structs, a function pointer, and macros. No potential security vulnerabilities were identified in this code. The functions and variables defined appear to be legitimate and are not directly executing user-controlled input or performing any operations that could lead to an exploit.

The struct definitions, function pointer declarations, and macros do not seem to introduce any obvious security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required.

ORIGINAL CODE:
struct qdisc_walker;
struct tcf_walker;
struct module;

typedef int tc_setup_cb_t(enum tc_setup_type type,
			  void *type_data, void *cb_priv);

};

struct qdisc_skb_cb {
	unsigned int		pkt_len;
	u16			slave_dev_queue_mapping;
	u16			tc_classid;
#define QDISC_CB_PRIV_LEN 20
	unsigned char		data[QDISC_CB_PRIV_LEN];
};
