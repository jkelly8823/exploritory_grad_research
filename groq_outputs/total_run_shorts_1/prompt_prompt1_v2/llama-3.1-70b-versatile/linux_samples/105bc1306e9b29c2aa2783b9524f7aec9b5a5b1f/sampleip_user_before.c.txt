VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is a set of header file inclusions for a C program. These inclusions are standard and do not pose any security risk on their own. No user input or sensitive data is being handled, and there are no operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <string.h> 

(Note: There is an unnecessary duplicate inclusion of the stdio.h header file, but this does not pose a security risk. It is more of a code-quality issue.)
