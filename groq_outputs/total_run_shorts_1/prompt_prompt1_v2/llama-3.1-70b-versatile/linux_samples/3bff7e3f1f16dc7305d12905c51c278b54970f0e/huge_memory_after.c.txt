VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Resource leak due to potential spinlock mismatch in locking order.
EXPLANATION:
The identified vulnerability is a resource leak caused by the possibility of a spinlock mismatch in the locking order. Specifically, on line 3, the code acquires the page lock using `lock_page(page)`, but on line 4, it unlocks the spin lock using `spin_unlock(vmf->ptl)` in a different order. This mismatch can lead to a deadlock if another thread is holding the spin lock while waiting for the page lock.

However, a closer look at the code shows that the `spin_unlock(vmf->ptl)` on line 3 is not the primary cause for concern. Instead, if `trylock_page(page)` fails, the code acquires the page lock again on line 4 and releases the spin lock `vmf->ptl`. 

Instead, the real vulnerability is that an additional spinlock `vmf->ptl` is held unnecessarily while `lock_page(page)` is being called on line 4, when the initial `trylock_page(page)` fails.

Note: Corrected to note spinlock `vmf->ptl` 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the identified vulnerability, it is recommended to release the spin lock `vmf->ptl` before re-acquiring the page lock:

        if (!trylock_page(page)) {
		get_page(page);
		spin_unlock(vmf->ptl); // this line can be called before lock_page, although lock_page is also an actual full page grab that will stop other processes reaching this page to some degree.
		//the following line isn't redundant, causes a pagelock and the subsequent unlock can be avoided using trylock but would cause delays.
		lock_page(page);
	}

Alternatively,  the lock_page has to include or maintain some kind of vmf ptl protection if required.


ORIGINAL CODE:
	page = pmd_page(orig_pmd);
	VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!PageHead(page), page);

	if (!trylock_page(page)) {
		get_page(page);
		spin_unlock(vmf->ptl);
		lock_page(page);
	}

	/*
	 * See do_wp_page(): we can only map the page writable if there are
	 * no additional references. Note that we always drain the LRU
	 * pagevecs immediately after adding a THP.
	 */
	if (page_count(page) > 1 + PageSwapCache(page) * thp_nr_pages(page))
		goto unlock_fallback;
	if (PageSwapCache(page))
		try_to_free_swap(page);
	if (page_count(page) == 1) {
		pmd_t entry;
		entry = pmd_mkyoung(orig_pmd);
		entry = maybe_pmd_mkwrite(pmd_mkdirty(entry), vma);
		if (pmdp_set_access_flags(vma, haddr, vmf->pmd, entry, 1))
		return VM_FAULT_WRITE;
	}

unlock_fallback:
	unlock_page(page);
	spin_unlock(vmf->ptl);
fallback:
	__split_huge_pmd(vma, vmf->pmd, vmf->address, false, NULL);
