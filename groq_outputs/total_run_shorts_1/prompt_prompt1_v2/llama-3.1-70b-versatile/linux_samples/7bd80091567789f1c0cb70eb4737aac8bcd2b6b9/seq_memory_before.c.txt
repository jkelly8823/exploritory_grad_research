VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double-free vulnerability due to lack of error checking in `snd_seq_cell_alloc`.
 
EXPLANATION:
There is a potential double-free vulnerability on lines 10-11. If `snd_seq_cell_alloc(pool, &cell, nonblock, file)` returns a success (0), but the subsequent call to `snd_seq_cell_alloc(pool, &tmp, nonblock, file)` returns an error (`err < 0`), the `cell` pointer will be leaked because the former allocation is not freed before entering the error branch (`goto __error`). 

However, in the non-error path, the code attempts to assign `tmp` to `cell->event.data.ext.ptr`. If this allocation were to be freed, it would double-free the `cell` pointer when it is eventually freed (not shown in this code snippet). 

Also, `tmp` is used without checking if the allocation was successful.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that `cell` is freed before entering the error branch using `kfree(cell)` when entering the error handling code path. Also, always check for successful allocations when using `snd_seq_cell_alloc`. If an allocation is successful, ensure that the allocated memory is used correctly and freed to prevent information leaks.
