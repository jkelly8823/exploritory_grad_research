VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No apparent vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger system, likely related to audio sequencing. It defines three function prototypes for managing sequence cells and events. There are no obvious vulnerabilities or security concerns within this snippet. The code does not seem to handle user input or interact with external systems, and the functions are declared with specific parameters, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected, no recommendations are provided for this code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void snd_seq_cell_free(struct snd_seq_event_cell *cell);

int snd_seq_event_dup(struct snd_seq_pool *pool, struct snd_seq_event *event,
		      struct snd_seq_event_cell **cellp, int nonblock, struct file *file);

/* return number of unused (free) cells */
static inline int snd_seq_unused_cells(struct snd_seq_pool *pool)
```
