VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet seems to be a part of a larger function or program that appears to be working with Intel graphics-specific commands and waivers. The code is relatively simple, and it does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or unchecked user input. However, without more context, it is difficult to assess the overall security of the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be secure, but it is always a good practice to follow secure coding practices, such as:

- Always validate user input and ensure it is within expected bounds.
- Properly handle and clean up system resources.
- Use secure coding standards for the specific programming language.
- Regularly review and update dependencies and libraries.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/* WaFlushCoherentL3CacheLinesAtContextSwitch:skl,bxt,glk */

batch = emit_lri(batch, lri, ARRAY_SIZE(lri));

/* WaMediaPoolStateCmdInWABB:bxt,glk */
if (HAS_POOLED_EU(engine->i915)) {
