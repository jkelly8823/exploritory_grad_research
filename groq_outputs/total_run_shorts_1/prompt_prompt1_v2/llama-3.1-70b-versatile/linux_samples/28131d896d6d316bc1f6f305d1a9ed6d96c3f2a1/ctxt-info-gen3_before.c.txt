VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be a routine configuration setup for debugging purposes. The operations being performed, such as modification of debug flags, assignment of addresses and sizes, and logging of debug messages, do not exhibit any exploitable vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are required as the code appears to be safe.

ORIGINAL CODE:
			dbg_flags |= IWL_PRPH_SCRATCH_EDBG_DEST_DRAM;
			dbg_cfg->hwm_base_addr = cpu_to_le64(frag->physical);
			dbg_cfg->hwm_size = cpu_to_le32(frag->size);
			IWL_DEBUG_FW(trans,
				     "WRT: Applying DRAM destination (alloc_id=%u, num_frags=%u)\n",
				     alloc_id,
				     trans->dbg.fw_mon_ini[alloc_id].num_frags);
