VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
I have examined the provided code snippet and found no potential vulnerabilities. The code appears to be part of a header file and defines constants and macro functions for bits manipulation. The operations and data types used are proper and do not pose a risk of security issues such as input validation errors, buffer overflows, or SQL injections. There are no function calls or dynamic memory allocations that could lead to potential vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations needed, the code appears secure within the provided snippet.
