VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of double-free vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION:
Upon reviewing the code, it appears that there are two calls to the `if_usb_free(cardp)` function, one in the `dealloc` function and another outside of it. This is problematic because it implies that the same resource is being freed twice. In C, freeing a resource that has already been freed can lead to undefined behavior, and can result in serious security vulnerabilities. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the line `if_usb_free(cardp);` at line 6 should be removed. This is because `dealloc` will presumably always run before main program flow, but in case of an error, dealloc isn't run and it was freed in error function.

ORIGINAL CODE:

dealloc:
	if_usb_free(cardp);
error:
lbtf_deb_leave(LBTF_DEB_MAIN);
	return -ENOMEM;
}

	/* Unlink and free urb */
	if_usb_free(cardp);

	usb_set_intfdata(intf, NULL);
	usb_put_dev(interface_to_usbdev(intf));
