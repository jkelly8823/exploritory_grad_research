VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 43, 45
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to missing array bounds checking in the handling of channel list.

EXPLANATION:
In the `wcn36xx_smd_update_channel_list` function, the `num_channel` variable is used to iterate over the `params->channels` array. However, there is a possibility of out-of-bounds write when `req->n_channels` exceeds `sizeof(msg_body->channels)`. This is because the `min_t` function only ensures that `num_channel` does not exceed `sizeof(msg_body->channels)`, but does not guarantee that the `req->channels` array has at least `req->n_channels` elements. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to validate that the `req->channels` array has at least `req->n_channels` elements before iterating over it. Additionally, perform bounds checking to prevent overwriting the `msg_body->channels` array.

Here is the recommended code:

```c
msg_body->num_channel = min_t(u8, req->n_channels, min_t(size_t, req->n_channels, sizeof(msg_body->channels)));
```

And also validate `req->channels` before accessing it:

```c
if (req->n_channels > 0 && req->channels != NULL) {
    for (i = 0; i < msg_body->num_channel; i++) {
        // ...
    }
} else {
    // handle invalid request or empty channel list
}
```
