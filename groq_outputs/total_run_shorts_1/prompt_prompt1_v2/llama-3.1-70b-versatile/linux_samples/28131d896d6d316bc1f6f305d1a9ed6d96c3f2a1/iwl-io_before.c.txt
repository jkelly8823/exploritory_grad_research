VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12, 16-17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks a condition with `if (cfg_trans->bisr_workaround)` and then performs an action. However, there is no protection against the condition changing between the check and the action. Although in this specific code snippet the condition is checked twice, the state of the system might change between the two checks. Additionally, the second check seems redundant and might be an attempt to correct the issue, but it only masks the real problem.

Furthermore, the same condition is not checked before the call to `iwl_poll_bit(trans, CSR_GP_CNTRL, poll_ready, poll_ready, 25000)` which also interacts with the `trans` object. This suggests that the state of `trans` or `cfg_trans->bisr_workaround` might change unexpectedly during the function execution, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, make sure that the state of `cfg_trans->bisr_workaround` does not change between the check and the action. This can be achieved by:

1. Synchronizing access to `cfg_trans->bisr_workaround` by using locks or other synchronization primitives.
2. Making sure that the state of `cfg_trans->bisr_workaround` is not changed by other threads or parts of the system during the execution of this function.
3. Avoid using redundant checks and instead use a single check with proper synchronization.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	return 0;
}

int iwl_finish_nic_init(struct iwl_trans *trans,
			const struct iwl_cfg_trans_params *cfg_trans)
{
	u32 poll_ready;
	int err;

	if (cfg_trans->bisr_workaround) {
	 * and accesses to uCode SRAM.
	 */
	err = iwl_poll_bit(trans, CSR_GP_CNTRL, poll_ready, poll_ready, 25000);
	if (err < 0)
		IWL_DEBUG_INFO(trans, "Failed to wake NIC\n");

	if (cfg_trans->bisr_workaround) {
		/* ensure BISR shift has finished */
		udelay(200);
	}
