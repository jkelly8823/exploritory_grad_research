VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unsupported Input Validation - Unvalidated use of potentially tainted values can lead to incorrect handling and potential denial of service.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the values of `inta_fh` and `inta_hw` are not validated prior to use in the error handling logic. It is unclear whether these values are directly derived from user input or external data, but their use in a context where errors are reported to the end user could be leveraged to inject misleading or forged error messages. 

Furthermore, when the code logs the error state with the comment "Microcode SW error detected. Restarting 0x%X.\n" the value of `inta_fh` is included directly in the output. This may not pose an immediate risk, but user-facing error messages should generally be sanitized to prevent exposure of potentially sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the values of `inta_fh` and `inta_hw` before using them in the error handling logic to prevent manipulation.
2. Implement additional input validation on these values to ensure they conform to expected formats and ranges.
3. Sanitize any user-facing error messages to prevent exposure of potentially sensitive information.
4. Review the code to ensure that error conditions do not reveal information about the internal workings of the system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	u32 inta_fh_msk = ~MSIX_FH_INT_CAUSES_DATA_QUEUE;
	u32 inta_fh, inta_hw;
	bool polling = false;

	if (trans_pcie->shared_vec_mask & IWL_SHARED_IRQ_NON_RX)
		inta_fh_msk |= MSIX_FH_INT_CAUSES_Q0;

		wake_up(&trans_pcie->ucode_write_waitq);
	}

	/* Error detected by uCode */
	if ((inta_fh & MSIX_FH_INT_CAUSES_FH_ERR) ||
	    (inta_hw & MSIX_HW_INT_CAUSES_REG_SW_ERR)) {
		IWL_ERR(trans,
			"Microcode SW error detected. Restarting 0x%X.\n",
			inta_fh);
		isr_stats->sw++;
