VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4, 11-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The `if_usb_free(cardp)` and `kfree(cardp)` functions are used to free the memory allocated to `cardp`. However, after freeing the memory, the code still attempts to access `cardp` in the line `if_usb_free(cardp)`. This is a use-after-free vulnerability, as the memory has already been freed and should not be accessed.

The line numbers 1-4 are vulnerable because they have multiple `kfree` operations, but these are actually redundant and could only result in incorrect functionality if the first operation actually fails. 

The line numbers 11-12 are vulnerable, specifically `usb_set_intfdata(intf, NULL)` does not result in an issue, but `usb_put_dev(interface_to_usbdev(intf))` does present potential risks of double free, as it calls a "put" reference on `interface_to_usbdev(intf)`, which may need to be verified is actually a freed operation.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the redundant `if_usb_free(cardp)` and `kfree(cardp)` calls. Verify that `usb_put_dev(interface_to_usbdev(intf))` does not attempt to free memory that has already been freed.

In this specific case, the `cardp` variable is first freed and then the code tries to free it again, but the line actually holds potential danger if the function `usb_set_intfdata(intf, NULL)` actually freed the `cardp` pointer earlier.

ORIGINAL CODE:


dealloc:
	if_usb_free(cardp);
	kfree(cardp);
error:
lbtf_deb_leave(LBTF_DEB_MAIN);
	return -ENOMEM;
}

	/* Unlink and free urb */
	if_usb_free(cardp);
	kfree(cardp);

	usb_set_intfdata(intf, NULL);
	usb_put_dev(interface_to_usbdev(intf));
```
