VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command injection vulnerability and resource leak

EXPLANATION:
I detected a possible command injection vulnerability due to the function `iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1` not being checked for. The lines `25-26` indicate that if `cmd_ver` is less than 7, `iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1` is called, but its susceptibility to a potential vulnerability is unknown. This poses a threat as different versions could have different vulnerabilities. Also, in line `5`, if `iwl_mvm_get_ctrl_pos(chandef)` fails, an error is not checked which can lead to a resource leak.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validation should be performed on `chandef` before it's used in a function.
- Validate the return value of `iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1` to prevent resource leak.
- Validate the versions that are calling `iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1` as older versions can have vulnerabilities.
- It is crucial to handle potential error to prevent the system from being vulnerable.
