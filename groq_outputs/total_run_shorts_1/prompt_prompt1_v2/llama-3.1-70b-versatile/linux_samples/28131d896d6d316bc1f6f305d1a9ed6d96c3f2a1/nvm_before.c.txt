VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, no potential vulnerabilities have been identified. The code snippet appears to be retrieving a SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) geographical profile from the mvm (mvm is likely a struct representing a device or device interface), and handling the result in a standard manner. The returned value is checked for errors and logging statements are used to print out the result of the function call. The function iwl_mvm_get_sar_geo_profile() is likely provided by an external library or another part of the codebase, but the snippet provided does not expose any vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are needed, as no vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
    return;

wgds_tbl_idx = iwl_mvm_get_sar_geo_profile(mvm);
if (wgds_tbl_idx < 0)
    IWL_DEBUG_INFO(mvm, "SAR WGDS is disabled (%d)\n",
               wgds_tbl_idx);
else
    IWL_DEBUG_INFO(mvm, "SAR WGDS: geo profile %d is configured\n",
               wgds_tbl_idx);
```
