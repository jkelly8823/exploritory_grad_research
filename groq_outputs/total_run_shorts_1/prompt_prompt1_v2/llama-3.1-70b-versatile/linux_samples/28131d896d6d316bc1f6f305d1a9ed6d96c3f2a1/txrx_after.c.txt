VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 105-109
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a memory corruption vulnerability in the function wcn36xx_unchain_msdu(). The issue arises when allocating memory for the skb_put() function. 
EXPLANATION:
In the wcn36xx_unchain_msdu() function, the code tries to allocate memory for skb_put() using the skb_tailroom() function to determine the available space in the skb. However, it does not check if the available space is sufficient to accommodate the data to be copied from the other skb. This can lead to a memory corruption issue if the available space is not sufficient.
Moreover, the skb_put() function does not check if the skb has enough space to accommodate the data before copying it. If the skb does not have enough space, it can lead to a memory overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the available space in the skb is sufficient to accommodate the data before copying it. The skb_put() function should also be modified to check if the skb has enough space before copying the data. Additionally, the code should handle the case when there is not enough space in the skb to prevent memory corruption.
Here is an example of how the code can be modified to fix this vulnerability:

```c
while ((skb = __skb_dequeue(amsdu))) {
    if(skb_tailroom(first) < skb->len) {
        // Handle the case when there is not enough space in the skb
        // This can be done by either allocating more memory for the skb or
        // by copying the data in chunks
    }
    skb_copy_from_linear_data(skb, skb_put(first, skb->len),
                              skb->len);
    dev_kfree_skb_irq(skb);
}
```
