VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This segment of code appears to be setting up configuration data for a wireless network interface. No vulnerabilities were detected in the code provided. The assignments to `wiphy` and `hw` structures seem to be standard practice for setting up wireless network configurations. The code is also setting up flags and interface types correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No changes are necessary as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
hw->vif_data_size = sizeof(struct mt7921_vif);

wiphy->iface_combinations = if_comb;
wiphy->flags &= ~(WIPHY_FLAG_IBSS_RSN | WIPHY_FLAG_4ADDR_AP |
              WIPHY_FLAG_4ADDR_STATION);
wiphy->interface_modes = BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION);
wiphy->n_iface_combinations = ARRAY_SIZE(if_comb);
wiphy->max_scan_ie_len = MT76_CONNAC_SCAN_IE_LEN;
wiphy->max_scan_ssids = 4;
