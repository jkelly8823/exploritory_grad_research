VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a C structure definition for a Wi-Fi adapter's firmware configuration. The structure contains fields for HWM base address, size, and debug token configuration. All fields are correctly defined with little-endian byte order and packed to avoid padding issues.

No potential vulnerabilities or security issues were identified in this code snippet. The use of `__packed` attribute is correct, as it ensures proper alignment of the structure in memory, and the use of little-endian fields (`__le64` and `__le32`) is also correct, as it ensures proper byte order for the fields.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
 * struct iwl_prph_scratch_hwm_cfg - hwm config
 * @hwm_base_addr: hwm start address
 * @hwm_size: hwm size in DWs
 * @debug_token_config: debug preset
 */
struct iwl_prph_scratch_hwm_cfg {
	__le64 hwm_base_addr;
	__le32 hwm_size;
	__le32 debug_token_config;
} __packed; /* PERIPH_SCRATCH_HWM_CFG_S */

/*
