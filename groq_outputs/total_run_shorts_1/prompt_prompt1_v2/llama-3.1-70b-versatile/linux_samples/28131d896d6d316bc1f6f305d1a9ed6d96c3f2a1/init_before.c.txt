VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No notable vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a wireless networking configuration, specifically for an MT7921 device. It sets various properties of the wireless interface, such as its modes, scan limits, and interface combinations. The code seems to be doing straightforward assignments and bit manipulations without any obvious vulnerabilities.

The code does not appear to handle any user input, and there are no apparent issues with buffer overflow, null pointer dereferences, or other common vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are provided for this code snippet as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
hw->vif_data_size = sizeof(struct mt7921_vif);

wiphy->iface_combinations = if_comb;
wiphy->flags &= ~WIPHY_FLAG_IBSS_RSN;
wiphy->interface_modes = BIT(NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION);
wiphy->n_iface_combinations = ARRAY_SIZE(if_comb);
wiphy->max_scan_ie_len = MT76_CONNAC_SCAN_IE_LEN;
wiphy->max_scan_ssids = 4;
