VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
This segment of code does not appear to introduce any vulnerabilities. It defines a preprocessor directive to conditionally include a macro definition. The code does not contain any user input, memory operations, or system calls that could potentially be exploited.

Since this is a preprocessor directive and does not execute any code, there is no immediate risk of exploitation. The directive simply controls whether a macro definition will be included or not, and the potential risks are entirely dependent on the content of the macro.
