VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No clear vulnerability is present in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a larger C codebase, likely related to the ath10k wireless driver for Linux. It defines several function prototypes and a macro, with conditional compilation blocks. Upon reviewing this code snippet, no clear vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, resource leaks, or insecure function calls are visible.

The presence of the `return NULL;` statement in the middle of the code snippet seems unclear, but without the broader context, it's difficult to assess whether this is an issue. However, this is likely due to a conditional compilation directive and is likely part of a larger, correctly structured if-else statement.

The code snippet provided doesn't perform any direct input validation or memory access, so potential vulnerabilities might be related to the functions it calls or the types it operates on, which aren't shown in this snippet. 

Given the information available, no clear vulnerabilities are present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for changes to this code snippet are needed.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c

const struct ath10k_hw_mem_layout *ath10k_coredump_get_mem_layout(struct ath10k *ar);

#else /* CONFIG_DEV_COREDUMP */

	return NULL;
}

static inline const struct ath10k_hw_mem_layout *
