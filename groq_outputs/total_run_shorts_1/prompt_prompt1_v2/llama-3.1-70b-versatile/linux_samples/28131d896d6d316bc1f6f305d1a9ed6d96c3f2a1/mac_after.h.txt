VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a declaration of an enumeration type (`enum iwl_mac_data_policy`) in C. This enumeration defines a set of flags for various IEEE 802.11 features. There are no indications of any security vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The use of the `BIT` macro suggests that the enumeration values are being bit-packed, which is a common and safe practice.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations for fixes are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 * @FLEXIBLE_TWT_SUPPORTED: AP supports flexible TWT schedule
 * @PROTECTED_TWT_SUPPORTED: AP supports protected TWT frames (with 11w)
 * @BROADCAST_TWT_SUPPORTED: AP and STA support broadcast TWT
 * @COEX_HIGH_PRIORITY_ENABLE: high priority mode for BT coex, to be used
 *	during 802.1X negotiation (and allowed during 4-way-HS)
 */
