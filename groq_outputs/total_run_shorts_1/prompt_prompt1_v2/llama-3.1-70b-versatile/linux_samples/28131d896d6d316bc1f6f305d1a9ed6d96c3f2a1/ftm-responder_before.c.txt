VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inconsistent or incorrect error handling due to missing error handling for a critical function call and lack of bounds checking for an unsigned integer.


EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a wireless network driver. It checks for the width of the channel definition and assigns the correct bandwidth and control channel position. However, there are potential issues with error handling. 

Inside the switch statement, there is no error handling when iwl_mvm_get_ctrl_pos function is called for a case width NL80211_CHAN_WIDTH_20_NOHT. It should be checked for potential failures or Null pointer dereferences. Additionally, in the conditional statement outside the switch statement, there are function calls iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2 and iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1, but their return values 'err' are not checked for errors. 

It is also worth noting that cmd_ver variable is not validated or sanitized in this code. If this is an unsigned integer, then it should ideally have a bounds check to avoid potential issues like integer wraparound. 


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Assign and validate the return value of iwl_mvm_get_ctrl_pos to prevent null pointer dereferences. 
- Validate and check for errors the return values of iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2 and iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1. Ideally, they should return specific error codes rather than relying on a generic 'err' value.
- Implement bounds checking for the 'cmd_ver' variable to ensure it falls within valid limits and is properly sanitized.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
}
static int iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2(struct cfg80211_chan_def *chandef,
					   u8 *format_bw,
					   u8 *ctrl_ch_position)
{
	switch (chandef->width) {
	case NL80211_CHAN_WIDTH_20_NOHT:
		*format_bw = IWL_LOCATION_FRAME_FORMAT_LEGACY;
		*format_bw |= IWL_LOCATION_BW_80MHZ << LOCATION_BW_POS;
		*ctrl_ch_position = iwl_mvm_get_ctrl_pos(chandef);
		break;
	default:
		return -ENOTSUPP;
	}

	if (cmd_ver >= 7)
		err = iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2(chandef, &cmd.format_bw,
						      &cmd.ctrl_ch_position);
	else
		err = iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1(chandef, &cmd.format_bw,
						      &cmd.ctrl_ch_position);
