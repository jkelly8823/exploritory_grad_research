VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities have been detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a simple conditional check on the values of three fields in the `pub_cfg` structure. If the sum of `grp0` and `grp1` does not equal `pub_max`, the function immediately returns. There are no obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, unvalidated input, or SQL injection attacks in the provided snippet. However, without more context, such as variable declarations or definitions, we cannot confirm the security of the code as a whole.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
const struct rtw89_hfc_pub_cfg *pub_cfg = &param->pub_cfg;

if (pub_cfg->grp0 + pub_cfg->grp1 != pub_cfg->pub_max)
    return 0;

return 0;
```
