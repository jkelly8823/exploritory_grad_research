VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet defines two custom data structures, `iwl_dbg_tlv_time_point_data` and forward declares two structs, `iwl_trans` and `iwl_fw_runtime`. The defined struct includes several linked lists for storing triggers, active triggers, host commands, and configurations. This snippet doesn't contain any code that performs any operations on the structures or variables, so no potential vulnerabilities were found.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
 * @trig_list: list of triggers
 * @active_trig_list: list of active triggers
 * @hcmd_list: list of host commands
 * @config_list: list of configuration
