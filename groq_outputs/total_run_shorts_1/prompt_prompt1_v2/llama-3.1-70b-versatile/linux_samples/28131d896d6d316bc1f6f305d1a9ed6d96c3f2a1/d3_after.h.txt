VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
This segment of code defines two structs (`iwl_wowlan_status_v6` and `iwl_wowlan_status_v7`) that contain certain fields to store information about WoWLAN status. The provided code appears to be a snippet from a larger header file, as evidenced by the `#endif` directive and commented-out TODO. Since there are no apparent data input paths or any dynamic memory allocation/mutation logic, there is no indication of common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, SQL injection, or command injection. 

Given the information and context provided, there are no identified vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
