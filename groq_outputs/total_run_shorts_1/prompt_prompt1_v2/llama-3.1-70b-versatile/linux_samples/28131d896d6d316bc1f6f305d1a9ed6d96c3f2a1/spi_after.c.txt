VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. It sets a variable, attempts to acquire a regulator, and probes for a WLcore device. The code properly checks the return values of functions and handles potential errors.

It is worth noting that this code is incomplete and lacks context about the functions and variables used. However, based on the provided code, there are no visible vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None, this code does not contain any visible vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
spi->bits_per_word = 32;

glue->reg = devm_regulator_get(&spi->dev, "vwlan");
if (IS_ERR(glue->reg))
    return dev_err_probe(glue->dev, PTR_ERR(glue->reg),
                         "can't get regulator\n");

ret = wlcore_probe_of(spi, glue, pdev_data);
if (ret) {
    dev_err(glue->dev,
