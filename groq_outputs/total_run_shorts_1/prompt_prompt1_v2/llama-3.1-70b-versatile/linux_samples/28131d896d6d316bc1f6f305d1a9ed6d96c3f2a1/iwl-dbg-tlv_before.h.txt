VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability found
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a C struct definition for a debug TLV (Type-Length-Value) time point data structure. It defines a struct with three linked lists for triggers, active triggers, and host commands. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The struct definition is simple and lacks any operations that could lead to security issues. This code snippet does not involve any input processing, data validation, or resource management, which are common sources of vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are necessary, as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
 * @trig_list: list of triggers
 * @active_trig_list: list of active triggers
 * @hcmd_list: list of host commands

	struct list_head trig_list;
	struct list_head active_trig_list;
	struct list_head hcmd_list;
};
