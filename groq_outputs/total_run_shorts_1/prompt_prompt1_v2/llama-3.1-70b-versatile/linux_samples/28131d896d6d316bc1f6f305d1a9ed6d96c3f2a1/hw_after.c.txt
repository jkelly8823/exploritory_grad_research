VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger Linux kernel driver implementation, specifically for 802.11 wireless network devices. The snippet defines a function to map from pdev index to hw mac index and two structs of type `ath11k_hw_hal_params` for hardware parameters. 

Upon analyzing the code, no obvious security vulnerabilities or defects were identified. The code primarily focuses on defining constants and performing bit manipulation operations, which are typically not prone to security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were identified.
