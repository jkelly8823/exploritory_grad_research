VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a struct `iwl_prph_scratch_hwm_cfg` in C, which represents a hardware configuration. The struct contains three fields: `hwm_base_addr`, `hwm_size`, and `reserved`. The fields are properly aligned using `__le64` and `__le32` types to ensure endianness. The `__packed` attribute is used to prevent padding between the struct fields. This struct seems to be a straightforward representation of a hardware configuration and doesn't appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are required since none were found. However, it's essential to ensure that this struct is being used properly in the context of the larger codebase, particularly with respect to memory management and data serialization.
