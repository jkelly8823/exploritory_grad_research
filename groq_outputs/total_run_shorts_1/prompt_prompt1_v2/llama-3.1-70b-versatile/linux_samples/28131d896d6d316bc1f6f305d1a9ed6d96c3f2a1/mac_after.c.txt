VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No identified vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
After evaluating the provided code snippet, no vulnerabilities were identified. The code appears to perform a simple validation check to ensure that the sum of `grp0` and `grp1` equals `pub_max`. If the condition is not met, an error is returned. This logic seems to be correct and does not pose any security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
const struct rtw89_hfc_pub_cfg *pub_cfg = &param->pub_cfg;

if (pub_cfg->grp0 + pub_cfg->grp1 != pub_cfg->pub_max)
    return -EFAULT;

return 0;
