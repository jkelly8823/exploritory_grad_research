VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a struct array `fixed_map` containing memory mappings for different DMA channels. The code is well-structured, and there are no obvious security vulnerabilities present. The data is hardcoded and not dependent on any user input, which reduces the risk of potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	u32 mapped;
	u32 size;
} fixed_map[] = {
	{ 0x54000000, 0x02000, 0x1000 }, /* WFDMA PCIE0 MCU DMA0 */
	{ 0x55000000, 0x03000, 0x1000 }, /* WFDMA PCIE0 MCU DMA1 */
	{ 0x58000000, 0x06000, 0x1000 }, /* WFDMA PCIE1 MCU DMA0 (MEM_DMA) */
	{ 0x59000000, 0x07000, 0x1000 }, /* WFDMA PCIE1 MCU DMA1 */
