EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a larger program handling certain wireless device settings. It checks whether a specific Geo profile is configured or not, then prints a message accordingly. 

The code checks the value of `wgds_tbl_idx` and handles both positive and negative values appropriately. No potential security risks or vulnerabilities have been identified in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	return;

	wgds_tbl_idx = iwl_mvm_get_sar_geo_profile(mvm);
	if (wgds_tbl_idx < 1)
		IWL_DEBUG_INFO(mvm,
			       "SAR WGDS is disabled or error received (%d)\n",
			       wgds_tbl_idx);
	else
		IWL_DEBUG_INFO(mvm, "SAR WGDS: geo profile %d is configured\n",
			       wgds_tbl_idx);
