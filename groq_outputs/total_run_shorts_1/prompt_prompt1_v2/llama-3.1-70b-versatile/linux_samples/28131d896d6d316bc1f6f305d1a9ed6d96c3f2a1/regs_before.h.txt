VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
None found.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a set of definitions for constants, macros, and bitmasks. It does not perform any operations that involve user input, memory allocation, or pointer manipulation, which are common sources of vulnerabilities.

Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, integer overflow, or SQL injection. The code snippet is primarily declarative and does not have any dynamic behavior that could potentially introduce security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
