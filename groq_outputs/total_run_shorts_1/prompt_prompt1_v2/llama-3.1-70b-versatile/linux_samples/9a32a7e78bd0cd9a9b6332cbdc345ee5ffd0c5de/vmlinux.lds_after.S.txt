VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7, 11-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet appears to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking when copying data with the *() operator.

EXPLANATION:
The *() operator is used to copy data from one location to another, but it does not perform any bounds checking to prevent overwriting memory beyond the intended buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, where an attacker can write arbitrary data to memory locations outside of the intended buffer, potentially allowing for code execution or other malicious activity.

In the provided code snippet, the *(__uaccess_flush_fixup) and *(__entry_flush_fixup) statements are used to copy data from the __uaccess_flush_fixup and __entry_flush_fixup buffers, respectively. However, there is no apparent bounds checking to prevent overwriting memory beyond the intended buffers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add bounds checking to ensure that the data being copied does not exceed the intended buffer size. This can be achieved by keeping track of the buffer size and checking that the amount of data being copied does not exceed it.

Additionally, you may want to consider using safer alternatives to the *() operator, such as memcpy() or memmove(), which do perform bounds checking.

ORIGINAL CODE:

__stop___stf_entry_barrier_fixup = .;
}

. = ALIGN(8);
__uaccess_flush_fixup : AT(ADDR(__uaccess_flush_fixup) - LOAD_OFFSET) {
	__start___uaccess_flush_fixup = .;
	*(__uaccess_flush_fixup)
	__stop___uaccess_flush_fixup = .;
}

. = ALIGN(8);
__entry_flush_fixup : AT(ADDR(__entry_flush_fixup) - LOAD_OFFSET) {
	__start___entry_flush_fixup = .;
	*(__entry_flush_fixup)
