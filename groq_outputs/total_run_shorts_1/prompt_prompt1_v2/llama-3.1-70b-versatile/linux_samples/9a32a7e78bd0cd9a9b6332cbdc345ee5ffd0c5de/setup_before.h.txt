VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in this code snippet.
 
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It defines a couple of function declarations, an inline function, and an extern boolean variable. However, given the lack of variable declarations and import statements, it's hard to make definitive judgments.

A closer examination of each declaration and function reveals no indication of obvious problems such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or potential data leaks. This is likely because these functions are only performing specific, narrowly defined tasks with parameters limited to type and boolean values.

Because this is just a small snippet, this analysis is naturally limited in regard to its ability identify issues within the encompassing codebase. Nevertheless, it appears as though it is secure on its own.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
