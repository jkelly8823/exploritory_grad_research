VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines several structs, specifically `struct irdma_mw_info`, `struct irdma_mw_alloc_info`, and `struct irdma_fast_reg_stag_info`. There is no apparent code execution, data assignment, or control flow that suggests any kind of vulnerability, such as buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. This code appears to be simply declaring data structures and their corresponding members.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None are necessary at this time.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
bool remote_access:1;
bool use_hmc_fcn_index:1;
bool use_pf_rid:1;
u8 hmc_fcn_index;
};

struct irdma_mw_alloc_info {
bool use_hmc_fcn_index:1;
u8 hmc_fcn_index;
bool use_pf_rid:1;
};

struct irdma_fast_reg_stag_info {
u64 wr_id;
