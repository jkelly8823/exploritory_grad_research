VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be three simple inline functions for accessing a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket's retransmission queue and write queue. The functions utilize skb_rb_first, skb_rb_last, and skb_peek, which are functions for accessing linked lists of network packets in the Linux kernel. No suspicious or vulnerable code was identified within the provided snippet. Given the context of network protocols and socket operations, this code seems to be innocuous.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations for fixes were identified.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return skb_rb_first(&sk->tcp_rtx_queue);
}

static inline struct sk_buff *tcp_rtx_queue_tail(const struct sock *sk)
{
return skb_rb_last(&sk->tcp_rtx_queue);
}

static inline struct sk_buff *tcp_write_queue_head(const struct sock *sk)
{
return skb_peek(&sk->sk_write_queue);
}
```
