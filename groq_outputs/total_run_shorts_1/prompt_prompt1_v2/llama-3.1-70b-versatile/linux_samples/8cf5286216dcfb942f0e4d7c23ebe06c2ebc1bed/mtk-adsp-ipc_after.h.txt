VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be related to Inter-Processor Communication (IPC) in a MTK (MediaTek) ADSP (Audio Digital Signal Processing) system. The functions seem to be responsible for setting and getting private data from an IPC structure. The provided code does not reveal any obvious vulnerabilities. The assignment and retrieval of private data is done in a straightforward and safe manner. Additionally, the function prototype for `mtk_adsp_ipc_send` does not contain any immediately apparent issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static inline void mtk_adsp_ipc_set_data(struct mtk_adsp_ipc *ipc, void *data)
{
	ipc->private_data = data;
}

static inline void *mtk_adsp_ipc_get_data(struct mtk_adsp_ipc *ipc)
{
	return ipc->private_data;
}

int mtk_adsp_ipc_send(struct mtk_adsp_ipc *ipc, unsigned int idx, uint32_t op);
```
