VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double-Use of kmem_cache_zalloc's returned memory pointer without null pointer check can lead to a potential Null Pointer Dereference.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses kmem_cache_zalloc() to allocate memory and stores the returned pointer in 'ns'. If kmem_cache_zalloc() fails to allocate memory, it returns a NULL pointer. However, there's no validation check to ensure 'ns' is not NULL before using it in subsequent operations. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if kmem_cache_zalloc() fails, potentially causing the system to crash or become unstable. 
Additionally, a good practice would be to include an explicit check for null, if GFP_KERNEL is involved in the memory allocation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
It's essential to validate 'ns' for NULL before using it.

```c
ns = kmem_cache_zalloc(user_ns_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!ns) {
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    goto fail_dec;
}
```
Would be rewritten to:
```c
ns = kmem_cache_zalloc(user_ns_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!ns) {
    ret = -ENOMEM;
    printk(KERN_INFO "%s: Failed kmem_cache_zalloc\n",__func__);
    goto fail_dec;
}
```
This makes sure 'ns' is not NULL and allows your error logging to clearly display the code location in system logs where kmem_cache_zalloc fails.
