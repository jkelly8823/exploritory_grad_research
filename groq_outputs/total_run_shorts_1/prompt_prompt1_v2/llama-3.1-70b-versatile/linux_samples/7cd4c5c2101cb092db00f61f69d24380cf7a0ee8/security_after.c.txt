VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a Linux kernel security module, using hook functions to interact with other parts of the kernel. The functions use call hooks to call other functions registered to these hooks.

Upon review of the provided code, I see no signs of potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, NULL pointer dereferences, or tainted data being used. There are no obvious cases of function calls with potentially malicious or untrusted input, and the return types and parameters seem correctly handled.

However, it's essential to note that I'm only examining this snippet in isolation. Assessment of security risks would be more comprehensive with more context and complete source code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are given, as this snippet doesn't show any security vulnerabilities. To ensure comprehensive security assessment, it is recommended to evaluate this function in context with its full usage and implementation within the larger kernel.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
call_void_hook(task_to_inode, p, inode);
}

int security_create_user_ns(const struct cred *cred)
{
	return call_int_hook(userns_create, 0, cred);
}

int security_ipc_permission(struct kern_ipc_perm *ipcp, short flag)
{
	return call_int_hook(ipc_permission, 0, ipcp, flag);
}
```
