VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4, 12-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains potential signed-to-unsigned integer conversion vulnerabilities, which may lead to security issues when the input data is not properly validated.

EXPLANATION:
The bug lies in lines 3-4 and lines 12-13, where unsigned long and addr_t are being used as bitmasks. If the input 'data' and 'tmp' are not properly validated, they may contain negative values which when used in bitwise operations with unsigned integers may produce incorrect results.

In lines 3-4, 'data' is assigned with the result of a bitwise operation involving unsigned long 'mask'. However, 'data' is not checked for potential signed-to-unsigned conversion before it is used in bitwise operations.

Similarly, in lines 12-13, 'tmp' is assigned with the result of a bitwise operation involving unsigned long 'mask'. However, 'tmp' is not checked for potential signed-to-unsigned conversion before it is used in bitwise operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the bug, perform input validation for 'data' and 'tmp' before they are used in bitwise operations. Ensure that 'data' and 'tmp' do not contain negative values that could cause signed-to-unsigned conversion issues.

Modify lines 3-4 to:
if ((unsigned long)data & ~mask) != PSW_USER_BITS)
        return -EINVAL;

Modify lines 12-13 to:
if ((unsigned long)tmp & ~mask) != PSW32_USER_BITS)
        /* Invalid psw mask. */
        return -EINVAL;
