VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated or improper use of user-controlled input to RCU read-lock handling
EXPLANATION:
The function skb_gro_postpull_rcsum(skb, greh, grehlen) is adjusting the checksum after skb_gro_pull() but before releasing the RCU read-lock. However, it is also updating internal data structures. The rcu_read_lock() unlocks the data structure, but if there is a concurrent update after skb_gro_postpull_rcsum(skb, greh, grehlen), this can result in an inconsistent data structure, leading to undefined behavior.

Moreover, this inconsistent data structure may lead to issues such as data corruption and a denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid this issue, a more rigorous semaphore strategy or version control on the updated data should be considered to prevent concurrent modification of the data structure when this function is called.

Moreover, review and verify that a proper check for the relevant pointer to the data structure and/or its version prior to releasing the RCU read-lock to avoid this inconsistent state in the data structure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/* Adjusted NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->csum after skb_gro_pull()*/
skb_gro_postpull_rcsum(skb, greh, grehlen);

pp = ptype->callbacks.gro_receive(head, skb);
flush = 0;

out_unlock:
rcu_read_unlock();
```
