VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure use of NAPI_GRO_CB(skb) in function gro_recursion_inc_test 

EXPLANATION:
The function gro_recursion_inc_test increments a counter (recursion_counter) stored within the NAPI_GRO_CB(skb) structure. However, this function does not perform any bounds checking against the maximum allowed recursion depth in the increment operation itself. Although it does check against the limit afterwards, a potential data overflow could occur in the increment operation before comparing to the limit.

Prior to the addition of the check against the recursion limit, in conditions with high recursion_depth, this counter has the possibility to wrap around. 

However it is likely in this code fragment that 'recursion_counter' is a signed integer and can take on the value of the negative as well as positive numbers.  With this signed addition it can prevent integer overflow. 
The problem in this context lies in line 15 and a full rewrite is also offered below the code recomenndations

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of incrementing 'recursion_counter' then comparing it against 'GRO_RECURSION_LIMIT' and implementing action based on result for potential recursion (particularly in the context of the inlined and function function) I reccomend implementing a before operation if recursion limit check then only increment counter when incrementing counter only when operation count is under recursion depth.

Specifically 
  - Implement before-operation checks 
- Prevent null deference by performing checks 
   or 
Instead use the code above where you now increment recursion counter in the condition itself.
