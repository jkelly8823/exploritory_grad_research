VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow due to insufficient error handling in copy_to_user function

EXPLANATION:
The copy_to_user function in the provided code snippet is used to copy data from the kernel space to the user space. The return value of this function indicates the number of bytes that could not be copied. However, the code only checks if the copy operation fails entirely, but does not check if the operation is partially successful. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the actual size of the data being copied is less than the size passed to the copy_to_user function.

Additionally, this function is prone to TOCTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use) issues, where the data being copied can be modified between the time it is checked for its size and when it is actually copied.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of copy_to_user to ensure that all data was successfully copied. If not, handle the error accordingly.
2. Consider using alternative functions like copy_in_user or get_user for copying data to avoid these issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
sockfd_put(csock);
	return err;
}
ca.name[sizeof(ca.name)-1] = 0;

err = hidp_connection_add(&ca, csock, isock);
if (!err && copy_to_user(argp, &ca, sizeof(ca)))
	err = -EFAULT;
```
