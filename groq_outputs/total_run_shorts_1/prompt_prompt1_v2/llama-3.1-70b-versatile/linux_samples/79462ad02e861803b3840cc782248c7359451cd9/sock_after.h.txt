VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in defining a constant `SK_PROTOCOL_MAX` with a large value (`U8_MAX`).

EXPLANATION:
The defined constant `SK_PROTOCOL_MAX` is set to `U8_MAX`, which is equivalent to 255. This large value may potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability when using this constant to define a field in a data structure, in this case, `sk_protocol : 8`. Although the field size is explicitly defined as 8 bits, defining a maximum value as `U8_MAX` might lead to misunderstandings when handling the field in other parts of the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this potential vulnerability, it is recommended to define `SK_PROTOCOL_MAX` based on the actual protocol values that will be used, rather than the maximum value for an 8-bit unsigned integer. For example:

```
#define SK_PROTOCOL_MAX 127
```

By defining a more realistic maximum value, you can reduce the chance of buffer overflows when handling the `sk_protocol` field.

ORIGINAL CODE:

			sk_no_check_rx : 1,
			sk_userlocks : 4,
			sk_protocol  : 8,
#define SK_PROTOCOL_MAX U8_MAX
			sk_type      : 16;
	kmemcheck_bitfield_end(flags);
	int			sk_wmem_queued;
	gfp_t			sk_allocation;
