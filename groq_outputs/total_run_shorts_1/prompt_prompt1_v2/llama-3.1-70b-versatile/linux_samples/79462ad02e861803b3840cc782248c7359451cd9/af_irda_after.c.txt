VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet does not contain any known security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a socket creation function in a network stack. It performs basic checks on protocol and network values to ensure they are within valid ranges. The function returns error codes if these checks fail, which is a good practice to prevent potential security issues. However, based on the provided code snippet, I did not identify any specific vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
struct sock *sk;
struct irda_sock *self;

if (protocol < 0 || protocol > SK_PROTOCOL_MAX)
    return -EINVAL;

if (net != &init_net)
    return -EAFNOSUPPORT;

/* Check for valid socket type */
```
