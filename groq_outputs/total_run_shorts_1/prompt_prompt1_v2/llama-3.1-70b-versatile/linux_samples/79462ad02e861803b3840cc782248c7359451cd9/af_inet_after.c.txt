VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a network protocol handling function. It checks the validity of the protocol number, and if it's within the allowed range, it sets the socket's state to unconnected. The code then jumps to a label named 'lookup_protocol' to presumably search for the requested protocol.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are available as no vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int try_loading_module = 0;
int err;

if (protocol < 0 || protocol >= IPPROTO_MAX)
    return -EINVAL;

sock->state = SS_UNCONNECTED;

/* Look for the requested type/protocol pair. */
lookup_protocol:
