VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
In the `mgmt_set_powered_failed` function, the `cmd_status` function call does not check for error codes that may indicate a memory corruption or invalid data.

EXPLANATION:
In the `mgmt_set_powered_failed` function, after obtaining the `status`, the `cmd_status` function is called with the obtained `status` value. However, the `cmd_status` function does not validate the `status` value before using it. This may lead to a potential vulnerability where the function `cmd_status` may write memory based on user-supplied data.

Furthermore, if the `cmd_status` function does not properly handle the `status` value, and the `status` value is large enough, it may cause a buffer overflow when writing the `status` to the memory location intended to store it.

The specific vulnerability in this code is that it does not validate the `err` value before converting it to a `status` value. Therefore, if `err` is not `-ERFKILL` and is larger than `MGMT_STATUS_FAILED`, the `status` value may not be valid. However, it will still be used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add validation for the `status` value before passing it to `cmd_status`.
- Check the `cmd_status` function to ensure it handles `status` values correctly and securely.
- Ensure that `status` is properly validated and bound-checked within `cmd_status` to prevent potential buffer overflows.
