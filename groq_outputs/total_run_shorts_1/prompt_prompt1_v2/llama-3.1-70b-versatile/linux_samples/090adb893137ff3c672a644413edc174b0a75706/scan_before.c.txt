VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the given code snippet, specifically in the memcpy function.

EXPLANATION:
The memcpy function is used to copy data from one buffer to another. In this case, the code is attempting to copy data from cmd_channels->channels_2 to cmd->channels_2, and from cmd_channels->channels_5 to cmd->channels_5. However, in the second memcpy function, the size of the destination buffer is specified as sizeof(cmd->channels_2), which is likely incorrect. The correct size should be sizeof(cmd->channels_5). This inconsistency could lead to a buffer overflow if the size of cmd->channels_5 is larger than cmd->channels_2.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the correct size should be used in the memcpy function. The corrected line should read:

 memcpy(cmd->channels_5, cmd_channels->channels_5,
       sizeof(cmd->channels_5));

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	memcpy(cmd->channels_2, cmd_channels->channels_2,
	       sizeof(cmd->channels_2));
	memcpy(cmd->channels_5, cmd_channels->channels_5,
	       sizeof(cmd->channels_2));
	/* channels_4 are not supported, so no need to copy them */
}
