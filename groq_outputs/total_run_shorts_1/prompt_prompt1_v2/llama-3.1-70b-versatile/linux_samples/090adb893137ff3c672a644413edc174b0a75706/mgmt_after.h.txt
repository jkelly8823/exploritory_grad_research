VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines several constants and a struct `mgmt_hdr` containing two little-endian 16-bit unsigned integers (`__le16`) for the opcode and index. After reviewing the code, no obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, potential integer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other types of attacks were detected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. Based on the given code snippet, there are no recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities as none were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define MGMT_STATUS_NOT_POWERED		0x0f
#define MGMT_STATUS_CANCELLED		0x10
#define MGMT_STATUS_INVALID_INDEX	0x11
#define MGMT_STATUS_RFKILLED		0x12

struct mgmt_hdr {
	__le16	opcode;
	__le16	index;
}
