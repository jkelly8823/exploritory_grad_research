VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds memory access in memcpy function call

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the memcpy function call in the rtl92cu_update_hal_rate_mask function, where the size of the memory being copied is 5 bytes, but the type of the destination pointer is u32, which on most platforms is 4 bytes long. This means that the memcpy function call will write 1 extra byte of memory beyond the allocated space for the rtlpriv->rate_mask array, potentially overwriting adjacent variables. This could potentially cause unexpected behavior or crashes.

Additionally, the same vulnerability exists in the previous functions calls to rtl_write_dword and rtl_read_dword.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the destination pointer is large enough to hold the data being copied. In this case, you can change the size of the memcpy function call to 4 bytes, or you can increase the size of the rtlpriv->rate_mask array to 5 bytes. However, since rate_mask is only 4 bytes in size on most platforms as it is a u32 pointer, you should only copy 4 bytes.

In addition, as this is only one instance in the body of this code. Upon reviewing the entire file or repository it would be a good idea to see if this is repeated elsewhere.
