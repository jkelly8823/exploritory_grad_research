VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Hardcoded Sensitive Data.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to contain hardcoded data, including numerical values in the format of hexadecimal addresses and associated data values. While these values appear to be technical in nature and might be related to some binary or firmware configuration, there is still a risk that some of this data could be sensitive and should not be hardcoded in the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Do not hardcode potentially sensitive data directly in the code.
- If the values are indeed technical in nature, use constants or enumerations instead, to provide clarity on their purpose and improve code readability.
- If these values are actually sensitive or security-relevant, extract them into environment variables or secure storage.
- Verify the security classification of these values in the context of the project.
