VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a declaration for a function, and definitions for some preprocessor macros and constants. It does not seem to have any potential security vulnerabilities.

The function il_add_beacon_time seems to be adding a beacon time to a base value and this snippet is incomplete since we do not know the actual code for this function.

The preprocessor macros and constants definition seems harmless as it just checks for a specific configuration and defines a constant based on it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for this code, since no vulnerabilities were detected.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
__le32 il_add_beacon_time(struct il_priv *il, u32 base, u32 addon,
			  u32 beacon_interval);

#ifdef CONFIG_PM
extern const struct dev_pm_ops il_pm_ops;

#define IL_LEGACY_PM_OPS	(&il_pm_ops)

#else /* !CONFIG_PM */

#define IL_LEGACY_PM_OPS	NULL

#endif /* !CONFIG_PM */
