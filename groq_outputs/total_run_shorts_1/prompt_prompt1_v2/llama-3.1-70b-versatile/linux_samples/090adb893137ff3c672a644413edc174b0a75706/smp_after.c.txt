VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Format String Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The first line `BT_DBG("conn %p hcon %p level 0x%2.2x", conn, hcon, sec_level);` uses a format string, but it is not validated to ensure that it matches the number and types of arguments provided. However, upon further examination, this appears to be a legitimate debugging print statement and does not seem to be an attack vector.

Upon closer inspection of the provided code, it appears that an "improper error handling" vulnerability exists.  Specifically on Line 1 of the provided code and  later on other lines e.g.. it returns 1  (" return 1" appears to indicate failure but  1 is a typical value for "true" on almost every platform) . However it returns an explicit TRUE/FALSE integer value from e.g  " BT_DBG()" is not but for comparison purposes a TRUE/FALSE would be better suited  which on many platforms is nonzero . The returns are confusing in respect.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
More correct practice in this situation would be to use typical error codes . That for instance returning zero indicates success whereas numbers different than zero do not.

Original_code is provided in slightly confusing parameters.



ORIGINAL CODE:
	BT_DBG("conn %p hcon %p level 0x%2.2x", conn, hcon, sec_level);

	if (!test_bit(HCI_LE_ENABLED, &hcon->hdev->dev_flags))
		return 1;

	if (sec_level == BT_SECURITY_LOW)
		return 1;
	__u8 reason;
	int err = 0;

	if (!test_bit(HCI_LE_ENABLED, &conn->hcon->hdev->dev_flags)) {
		err = -ENOTSUPP;
		reason = SMP_PAIRING_NOTSUPP;
		goto done;
	}
