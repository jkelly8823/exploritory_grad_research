VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 146-148
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the l2cap_config_rsp function.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is located in the l2cap_config_rsp function where the variable len is calculated as le16_to_cpu(cmd->len) - sizeof(*rsp). This calculation does not take into account the potential for a malicious cmd->len value that could cause len to be a large value, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when used to access the chan->conf_len array.

However, a more significant issue is that the code lacks error handling and validation for the values of cmd->len, rsp->scid, rsp->flags, and rsp->result. The __le16_to_cpu function does not check for overflows or invalid values. A malicious data packet could cause the function to access invalid memory or perform undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the values of cmd->len, rsp->scid, rsp->flags, and rsp->result before using them. This could include checks for valid ranges, overflows, and invalid values.
2. Implement error handling to handle cases where the values are invalid or out of range.
3. Use safe functions to handle conversions between endianness.
4. Consider using AddressSanitizer or other memory error detection tools to detect potential buffer overflows and other memory-related issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
(limited to first function to save space)
static inline int l2cap_command_rej(struct l2cap_conn *conn,
				    struct l2cap_cmd_hdr *cmd, u8 *data)
{
	struct l2cap_cmd_rej_unk *rej = (struct l2cap_cmd_rej_unk *) data;

	if (rej->reason != L2CAP_REJ_NOT_UNDERSTOOD)
		return 0;

	if ((conn->info_state & L2CAP_INFO_FEAT_MASK_REQ_SENT) &&
