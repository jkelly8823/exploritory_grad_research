# (No actual code was present, only a comment)

or otherwise protected/tainted binaries. The modes are

0 - (default) - traditional behaviour. Any process which has changed
	privilege levels or is execute only will not be dumped
1 - (debug) - all processes dump core when possible. The core dump is
	owned by the current user and no security is applied. This is
	intended for system debugging situations only. Ptrace is unchecked.
2 - (suidsafe) - any binary which normally would not be dumped is dumped
	readable by root only. This allows the end user to remove
	such a dump but not access it directly. For security reasons
	core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one another or
	other files. This mode is appropriate when administrators are
	attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.
