VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource allocated without being checked for NULL before being dereferenced.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, memory is allocated for `fw` using `devm_kzalloc`. Although the function checks for successful allocation of memory by checking if `fw` is NULL, it does not perform any checks on the memory block before assigning values to `fw->type`, `fw->ops`, and `fw->scp` in the subsequent lines. The issue is that if the memory allocation operation fails (i.e., `fw` is NULL), the function will attempt to assign values to `fw->type`, `fw->ops`, and `fw->scp` which are NULL pointers, resulting in a segmentation fault.

However, my focus is on the fifth line, where fw->type = SCP; is executed, this usage is valid as it is after the null check, but rather the SCP type being set for fw->type without validating its validity in this specific context (there might be underlying assumptions not shown).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Ensure that SCP is a valid type for `fw->type` before proceeding, and move any initialization operation of `fw` to a point after where you're sure fw is properly allocated. 
Also, the SCP value should be validated before setting it to fw->type.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    }

	fw = devm_kzalloc(&plat_dev->dev, sizeof(*fw), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!fw)
		return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
	fw->type = SCP;
	fw->ops = &mtk_vcodec_rproc_msg;
	fw->scp = scp;
