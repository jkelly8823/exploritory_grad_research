VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be function declarations for managing file space allocation in an XFS context. The functions provided perform allocation, deallocation, and collapse operations on file space. Our analysis did not detect any security vulnerabilities in these function declarations. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None
