VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of deprecated ioctl commands.

EXPLANATION:
The use of deprecated ioctl commands such as XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP, XFS_IOC_FREESP, XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64, and XFS_IOC_FREESP64 can lead to potentially security vulnerabilities due to inadequate validation and sanitization. These commands are marked as deprecated and their use is discouraged.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended solution is to replace the deprecated ioctl commands with their suggested counterparts, such as the fallocate(2) system call. This will provide better validation and sanitization of user input and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
return error;
}

/* Return 0 on success or positive error */

	struct xfs_ibulk		*breq,
	case XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP:
	case XFS_IOC_FREESP:
	case XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64:
	case XFS_IOC_FREESP64:
		xfs_warn_once(mp,
"%s should use fallocate; XFS_IOC_{ALLOC,FREE}SP ioctl unsupported",
				current->comm);
		return -ENOTTY;
	case XFS_IOC_DIOINFO: {
		struct xfs_buftarg	*target = xfs_inode_buftarg(ip);
