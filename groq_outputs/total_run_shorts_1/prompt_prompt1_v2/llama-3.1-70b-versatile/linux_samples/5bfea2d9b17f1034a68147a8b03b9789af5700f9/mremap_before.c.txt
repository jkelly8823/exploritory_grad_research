VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Uncontrolled Recursion in move_ptes() Function

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet seems to be part of a memory management function. However, there's an indication that this function might be recursive, given the comment referencing move_ptes() function. Although the actual function definition is not provided in the snippet, the presence of a variable named "need_rmap_locks" in this context and a nested conditional structure with recursive behavior that might occur in "move_ptes()" functions potentially leads to uncontrolled recursion that may cause a stack overflow vulnerability. 

Additionally, "is_swap_pmd(*old_pmd)" and "pmd_trans_huge(*old_pmd)" could potentially lead to indirect function calls without any validation, making the function vulnerable to unintended behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this potential vulnerability:
- Validate the input in "move_ptes()" function, if it exists.
- Check if the recursion is properly bounded to prevent stack overflow.
- If indirect function calls are intended, ensure they are validated properly.
- Improve input validation to prevent any unexpected conditions.
- Provide proper error handling for both the inner function call, here the call referencing move_ptes(), as well as this section, to prevent hidden error behavior.


ORIGINAL CODE:
        new_pmd = alloc_new_pmd(vma->vm_mm, vma, new_addr);
		if (!new_pmd)
			break;
		if (is_swap_pmd(*old_pmd) || pmd_trans_huge(*old_pmd)) {
			if (extent == HPAGE_PMD_SIZE) {
				bool moved;
				/* See comment in move_ptes() */
				if (need_rmap_locks)
