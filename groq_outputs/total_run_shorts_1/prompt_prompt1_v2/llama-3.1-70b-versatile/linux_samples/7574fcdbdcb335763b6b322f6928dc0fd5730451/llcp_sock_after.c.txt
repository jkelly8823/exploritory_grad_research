VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Use After Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents a use after free vulnerability. At line 2, `llcp_sock->service_name` is freed using `kfree()`, and immediately set to `NULL`. However, there is no guarantee that `llcp_sock` and its contents are still valid after the `sock_llcp_release` function is called, which occurs later. This could potentially lead to a use after free vulnerability if `llcp_sock` is accessed after the `sock_llcp_release` function is called.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the `sock_llcp_release` function should be called before freeing any part of `llcp_sock`. Additionally, `llcp_sock` should be checked for `NULL` before attempting to access its members after the `sock_llcp_release` function has been called. 

```c
sock_unlink:
	nfc_llcp_sock_unlink(&local->connecting_sockets, sk);
	sock_llcp_release:
		nfc_llcp_put_ssap(local, llcp_sock->ssap);
		nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local);
	kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);
	llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
sock_unlink:
	nfc_llcp_sock_unlink(&local->connecting_sockets, sk);
	kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);
	llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;

sock_llcp_release:
	nfc_llcp_put_ssap(local, llcp_sock->ssap);
	nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local);
```
