VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet appears to be a series of function declarations and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet consists of function declarations, which define the interface of the functions without revealing their implementation. These functions seem to be related to CIFS (Common Internet File System) and deal with file system operations. Since this is a declaration-only snippet, we cannot assess the actual behavior of these functions. There are no visible signs of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, unsanitized user input, or misuse of resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no recommended fixes for this code, as it appears to be a collection of function declarations without any inherently vulnerable code.
