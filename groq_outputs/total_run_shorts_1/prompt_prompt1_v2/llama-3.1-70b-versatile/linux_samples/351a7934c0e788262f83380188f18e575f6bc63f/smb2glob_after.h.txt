VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to contain preprocessor directives that define constants for use in SMB2 and SMB3 protocols. It does not contain any executable code or operations that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

Given the provided context and available information, there is no indication of any potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are necessary. However, as a best practice, it is essential to review the entire codebase and perform security audits to ensure that there are no other vulnerabilities present.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define SMB2_CMACAES_SIZE (16)
#define SMB3_SIGNKEY_SIZE (16)

/* Maximum buffer size value we can send with 1 credit */
#define SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 65536

#endif	/* _SMB2_GLOB_H */
