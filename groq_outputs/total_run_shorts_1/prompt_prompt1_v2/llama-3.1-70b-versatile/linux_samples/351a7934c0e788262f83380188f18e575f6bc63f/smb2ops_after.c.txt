VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer truncation or overflow vulnerability due to inadequate checks on 'volume_info->wsize' and 'volume_info->rsize' when assigning to 'wsize' and 'rsize'.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, 'volume_info->wsize' and 'volume_info->rsize' are assigned to 'wsize' and 'rsize' respectively. However, there is a potential integer truncation or overflow vulnerability because the code does not check the range of these values properly. 

The code checks if 'wsize' and 'rsize' are less than certain maximum values ('server->max_write', 'server->max_read', and 'SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE'), but it does not check the minimum value. If 'volume_info->wsize' or 'volume_info->rsize' are very large or very small, they can be truncated or overflows when assigned to 'wsize' and 'rsize' respectively.

Moreover, the code uses 'min_t' with 'unsigned int' type. However, if 'volume_info->wsize' or 'volume_info->rsize' are signed integers with negative value, they will be interpreted as large unsigned integers when passed to 'min_t', which can cause incorrect comparison.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to add checks for both minimum and maximum values before assigning 'volume_info->wsize' to 'wsize' and 'volume_info->rsize' to 'rsize'. Also, make sure that all variables involved have consistent signedness or convert them to the same type before comparing.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	/* start with specified wsize, or default */
	wsize = volume_info->wsize ? volume_info->wsize : CIFS_DEFAULT_IOSIZE;
	wsize = min_t(unsigned int, wsize, server->max_write);
	/* set it to the maximum buffer size value we can send with 1 credit */
	wsize = min_t(unsigned int, wsize, SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE);

	return wsize;
}

	/* start with specified rsize, or default */
	rsize = volume_info->rsize ? volume_info->rsize : CIFS_DEFAULT_IOSIZE;
	rsize = min_t(unsigned int, rsize, server->max_read);
	/* set it to the maximum buffer size value we can send with 1 credit */
	rsize = min_t(unsigned int, rsize, SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE);

	return rsize;
}
