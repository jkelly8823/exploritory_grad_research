None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a configuration block from the Linux CIFS (Common Internet File System) module. It checks for the presence of certain configuration options and defines function pointers for getting and setting access control lists (ACLs). There are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for Linux kernel development. However, it is essential to note that this is a small snippet, and a comprehensive security review would require examining the surrounding code and its interactions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
#endif /* CIFS_XATTR */
#ifdef CONFIG_CIFS_ACL
    .get_acl = get_cifs_acl,
    .get_acl_by_fid = get_cifs_acl_by_fid,
    .set_acl = set_cifs_acl,
#endif /* CIFS_ACL */
};
