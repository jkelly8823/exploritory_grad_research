VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not find any potential security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a section of a C program that checks for conditional compilation flags (CONFIG_CIFS_ACL) and assigns function pointers (.get_acl and .set_acl) based on those flags. This is a standard and innocuous pattern for handling platform-specific functionality. 
Without additional context or information, this snippet does not reveal any potential security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
#endif /* CIFS_XATTR */
#ifdef CONFIG_CIFS_ACL
	.get_acl = get_cifs_acl,
	.set_acl = set_cifs_acl,
#endif /* CIFS_ACL */
};
