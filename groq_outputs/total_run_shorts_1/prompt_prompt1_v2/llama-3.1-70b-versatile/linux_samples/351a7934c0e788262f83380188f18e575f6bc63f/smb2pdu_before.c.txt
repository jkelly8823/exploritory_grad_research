VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a lack of validation of external data, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. The `SecurityMode` received from the server is not validated before it's used to set `server->sec_mode`.

EXPLANATION:
The line of code `server->sec_mode = le16_to_cpu(rsp->SecurityMode);` directly assigns the received `SecurityMode` from the server response without checking its validity. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the security mode and lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. The code includes a comment "BB Do we need to validate the SecurityMode?" which suggests that the developers are aware of this potential vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to validate the `SecurityMode` received from the server before assigning it to `server->sec_mode`. This can be done by checking if the received value is within a valid range or matches the expected values. Additionally, consider implementing error handling for cases where the received `SecurityMode` is invalid.

Example of validation:
```c
if ((rsp->SecurityMode & CIFS_SEC_MASK) <= CIFS_SEC_MAX) {
    server->sec_mode = le16_to_cpu(rsp->SecurityMode);
} else {
    // handle invalid security mode
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:


    /* SMB2 only has an extended negflavor */
    server->negflavor = CIFS_NEGFLAVOR_EXTENDED;
    server->maxBuf = le32_to_cpu(rsp->MaxTransactSize);
    server->max_read = le32_to_cpu(rsp->MaxReadSize);
    server->max_write = le32_to_cpu(rsp->MaxWriteSize);
    /* BB Do we need to validate the SecurityMode? */
    server->sec_mode = le16_to_cpu(rsp->SecurityMode);
