VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability identified.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a function that calculates the optimal write and read sizes for a CIFS (Common Internet File System) server. The code checks for specified sizes and limits them to the server's maximum supported sizes and an internal limit of 2^16. This is done to prevent multicredit requests.

The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as user input not being validated or unsanitized, or potential buffer overflow conditions. The min_t() function is used to ensure that the write and read sizes are within acceptable limits.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/* start with specified wsize, or default */
wsize = volume_info->wsize ? volume_info->wsize : CIFS_DEFAULT_IOSIZE;
wsize = min_t(unsigned int, wsize, server->max_write);
/*
 * limit write size to 2 ** 16, because we don't support multicredit
 * requests now.
 */
wsize = min_t(unsigned int, wsize, 2 << 15);

return wsize;
}

/* start with specified rsize, or default */
rsize = volume_info->rsize ? volume_info->rsize : CIFS_DEFAULT_IOSIZE;
rsize = min_t(unsigned int, rsize, server->max_read);
/*
 * limit write size to 2 ** 16, because we don't support multicredit
 * requests now.
 */
rsize = min_t(unsigned int, rsize, 2 << 15);

return rsize;
}
```
