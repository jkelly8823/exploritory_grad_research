VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines two constants related to SMB2 and SMB3 encryption. The constants SMB2_CMACAES_SIZE and SMB3_SIGNKEY_SIZE are used to specify the size of encryption keys. No vulnerabilities have been found in this code snippet, as it only defines constants and does not contain any logic or operations that could be exploited.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define SMB2_CMACAES_SIZE (16)
#define SMB3_SIGNKEY_SIZE (16)

#endif  /* _SMB2_GLOB_H */
