VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains preprocessor macros and a struct declaration. The macros are simple mathematical operations that seem to be intended for merging two 32-bit integers into a single 64-bit integer and limiting resource values to 32-bit ranges. The struct declaration is empty and seems incomplete, but this alone does not indicate a vulnerability. No suspicious or potentially exploitable code patterns were identified in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as there are no detected vulnerabilities.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define merge_64(r1, r2) ((((r2) & 0xffffffffUL) << 32) + ((r1) & 0xffffffffUL))
#endif

#define RLIM_INFINITY32 0x7fffffff
#define RESOURCE32(x) ((x > RLIM_INFINITY32) ? RLIM_INFINITY32 : x)

struct rlimit32 {
