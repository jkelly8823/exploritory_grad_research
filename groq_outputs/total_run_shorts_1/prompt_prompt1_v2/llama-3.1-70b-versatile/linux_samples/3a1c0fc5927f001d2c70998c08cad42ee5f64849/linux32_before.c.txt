VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No security vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a Linux kernel implementation, containing a definition for a macro, a system call definition, and some resource limiting constants. The code seems to be handling memory mapping and resource limits. No obvious vulnerabilities were detected, such as potential buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or arithmetic overflows. The code appears to be correctly using bitwise operations and logical checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None recommended. The code appears to be correctly handling potential issues and edge cases.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#define merge_64(r1, r2) ((((r2) & 0xffffffffUL) << 32) + ((r1) & 0xffffffffUL))

		return -EINVAL;
	return ksys_mmap_pgoff(addr, len, prot, flags, fd,
			       pgoff >> (PAGE_SHIFT-12));
