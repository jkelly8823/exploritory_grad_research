VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a wireless driver, specifically setting status flags within a driver's memory space. It sets two flags, `IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART` and `IWL_MVM_STATUS_D3_RECONFIG`, which seems to be related to handling hardware restart and device configuration.

The code snippet does not seem to handle any external input, and there is no apparent opportunity for data corruption or manipulation. The code simply sets status flags within the driver's memory space.

Without additional context or knowing the surrounding code, I couldn't find any sensitive information or vulnerabilities within this snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations for changes are necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	 *
	 * 1. We are not using a unified image
	 * 2. We are using a unified image but had an error while exiting D3

	/*
	 * When switching images we return 1, which causes mac80211
