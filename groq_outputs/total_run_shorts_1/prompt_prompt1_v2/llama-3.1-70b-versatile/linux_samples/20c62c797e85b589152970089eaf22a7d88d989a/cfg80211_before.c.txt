VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Inconsistent Return Statement, Potential Use After Free.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains two potential vulnerabilities. The first one lies in the inconsistent return statement. If the `qtnf_cmd_send_stop_ap(vif)` function fails and `ret` is non-zero, the function will print an error message but continue executing. However, the `!qtnf_sta_list_lookup(&vif->sta_list, params->mac)` line seems to be incorrectly indented and does not appear to be a condition for a return statement. If this line was actually intended to check the result of `qtnf_sta_list_lookup`, it could potentially cause the function to return prematurely without finishing its execution. The second vulnerability could be a potential use after free. After `qtnf_cmd_send_del_sta(vif, params)` is called, it's not clear if the memory for `vif` is freed, but the following lines still use `vif`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consistently handle error conditions and return statements. Also, examine the code flow and boundaries to ensure that no memory access is made after free.

There is also an undefined variable `params` used throughout the function, which may indicate an issue with the given code snippet.

Additionally, to clarify the intent of the code, correct the indentation for the `!qtnf_sta_list_lookup(&vif->sta_list, params->mac)` line.

ORIGINAL CODE:


	vif = qtnf_netdev_get_priv(wdev->netdev);

	if (qtnf_cmd_send_del_intf(vif))
		pr_err("VIF%u.%u: failed to delete VIF\n", vif->mac->macid,
		       vif->vifid);

	struct qtnf_vif *vif = qtnf_netdev_get_priv(dev);
	int ret;

	ret = qtnf_cmd_send_stop_ap(vif);
	if (ret) {
		pr_err("VIF%u.%u: failed to stop AP operation in FW\n",
		       vif->mac->macid, vif->vifid);
	    !qtnf_sta_list_lookup(&vif->sta_list, params->mac))
		return 0;

	qtnf_scan_done(vif->mac, true);

	ret = qtnf_cmd_send_del_sta(vif, params);
	if (ret)
		pr_err("VIF%u.%u: failed to delete STA %pM\n",
		       vif->mac->macid, vif->vifid, params->mac);
		}

		vif->sta_state = QTNF_STA_DISCONNECTED;
		qtnf_scan_done(mac, true);
	}
}
