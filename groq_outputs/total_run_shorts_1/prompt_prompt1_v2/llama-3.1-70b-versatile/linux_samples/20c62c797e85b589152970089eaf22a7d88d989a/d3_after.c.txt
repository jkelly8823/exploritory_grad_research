VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerability found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a section of code related to Wi-Fi device management, specifically handling unified image and restart requests. It sets two bits in the mvm->status variable to indicate a hardware restart request and D3 reconfiguration, respectively.

The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as input validation issues, buffer overflows, or use-after-free conditions. The function calls and variable accesses appear to be straightforward and do not indicate any potential security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed for this code snippet, as no vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
 * 1. We are not using a unified image
 * 2. We are using a unified image but had an error while exiting D3
 */
set_bit(IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED, &mvm->status);
set_bit(IWL_MVM_STATUS_D3_RECONFIG, &mvm->status);
/*
 * When switching images we return 1, which causes mac80211
 * to do a reconfig with IEEE80211_RECONFIG_TYPE_RESTART.
