VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code appears to be a part of a kernel module or device driver, written in C. It checks if a timer is pending, deletes it if so, and then calls the qtnf_scan_done function based on the status flags. There are no obvious memory leaks, unhandled user input, or pointer arithmetic issues that would suggest a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    return -EINVAL;
}

if (timer_pending(&mac->scan_timeout))
    del_timer_sync(&mac->scan_timeout);
qtnf_scan_done(mac, le32_to_cpu(status->flags) & QLINK_SCAN_ABORTED);

return 0;
