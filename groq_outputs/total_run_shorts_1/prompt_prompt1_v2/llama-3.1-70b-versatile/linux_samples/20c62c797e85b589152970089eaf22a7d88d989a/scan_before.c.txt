VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Unchecked or unhandled return values potentially leading to a TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check to Time-Of-Use) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The function `iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status` is called with the `cmd` struct, which only has the `id` field initialized. Other fields in the `cmd` struct may be left uninitialized or default-initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the `status` variable is also not checked for potential errors or invalid values after the function call, potentially leading to a TOCTOU vulnerability.

Additionally, the function `iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status` is not checked for a 'bad return' where the function might have been success, but the system have actually changed between the check and the use (TOCTOU).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 The function `iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status` should be called with a fully initialized `cmd` struct, and the `status` variable should be checked for potential errors or invalid values after the function call. A manual code audit should be performed to ensure all paths returning from `iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status` are properly checked and handled.

 The code should also be reviewed to consider potential TOCTOU vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    struct iwl_host_cmd cmd = {
        .id = SCAN_OFFLOAD_ABORT_CMD,
    };
    u32 status;

    ret = iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status(mvm, &cmd, &status);
    if (ret)
        return ret;
