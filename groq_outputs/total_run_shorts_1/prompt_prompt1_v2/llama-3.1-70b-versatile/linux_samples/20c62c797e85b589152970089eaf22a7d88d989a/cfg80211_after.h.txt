VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The potential vulnerability exists in the `cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info)` function call. The code assumes that `mac->scan_req` is non-null, but there is no explicit null check before passing this pointer to the function. If `mac->scan_req` is null, this could lead to a null pointer dereference vulnerability, which could potentially be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, add a null check before calling `cfg80211_scan_done`:
```
if (mac->scan_req) {
    cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info);
}
```
Alternatively, if `cfg80211_scan_done` can handle null pointers, ensure that it is properly documented as such. However, based on the provided code, this seems unlikely.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
		.aborted = aborted,
	};

	if (timer_pending(&mac->scan_timeout))
		del_timer_sync(&mac->scan_timeout);

	mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock);

	if (mac->scan_req) {
		cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info);
```
