VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to not checking the status of the command after it was sent.
EXPLANATION:
Although the function checks the return value of `iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status` and returns early if an error occurs, the status of the command is not checked after it was sent. This could potentially lead to a resource leak if the command fails but the status is not checked.

Additionally, the variable `CAN_ABORT_STATUS` is used directly without any checks, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the status of the command is not as expected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Check the status of the command after it was sent, and handle any potential error cases. Here's an example:

  ```c
struct iwl_host_cmd cmd = {
  .id = SCAN_OFFLOAD_ABORT_CMD,
};
u32 status = CAN_ABORT_STATUS;

ret = iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status(mvm, &cmd, &status);
if (ret) {
  return ret;
}

// Check the status of the command
if (status != CAN_ABORT_STATUS) {
  // Handle the case where the status is not as expected
  return -EIO;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
  ```c
struct iwl_host_cmd cmd = {
  .id = SCAN_OFFLOAD_ABORT_CMD,
};
u32 status = CAN_ABORT_STATUS;

ret = iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status(mvm, &cmd, &status);
if (ret)
  return ret;
  ```
