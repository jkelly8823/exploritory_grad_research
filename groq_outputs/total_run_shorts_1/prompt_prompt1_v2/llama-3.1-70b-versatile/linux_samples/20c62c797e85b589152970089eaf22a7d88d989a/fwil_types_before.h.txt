VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
There are no identified vulnerabilities in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a section of a header file containing a series of macro definitions for constants related to wireless network scanning. The definitions seem straightforward and do not involve any direct input or output operations, which reduces the risk of common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or SQL injection attacks. Furthermore, there are no function calls, array accesses, or pointer manipulations that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. This code snippet appears to be safe from vulnerabilities.
