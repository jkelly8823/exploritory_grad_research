VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Use of an unlocked, potentially shared resource.

EXPLANATION:
The mutex_lock call on line 3 suggests that the code is designed to protect shared resources using a mutex. However, the variable "mac->scan_req" is accessed and used on line 5 without any locking protection. If multiple threads or contexts may access or modify "mac->scan_req" at the same time, this could result in a data race condition or unexpected behavior.

Additionally, the cfg80211_scan_done function call on line 5 may potentially access or modify shared resources, which could conflict with the mutex lock on line 3 if not properly synchronized.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that all accesses to shared resources, including "mac->scan_req" and any resources accessed by the cfg80211_scan_done function call, are properly synchronized using a lock. 

This can be achieved by ensuring the mutex lock is held before accessing the shared resource and releasing the lock when the access is complete. 

Here's an example:

```c
mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock);
if (mac->scan_req) {
    cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info);
}
mutex_unlock(&mac->mac_lock);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

        .aborted = aborted,
    };

    mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock);

    if (mac->scan_req) {
        cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info);
