VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of a header file, specifically defining various data structures and types for a kernel-based virtual machine (KVM). The code is structured in a way that defines a set of enums and structs, which are used to represent memory regions and cache entries.

Upon examining the code snippet, no obvious security vulnerabilities were identified. There are no apparent issues with user input handling, memory management, or cryptographic operations that could be exploited by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed for this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:


enum kvm_mr_change;

#include <linux/types.h>

/*
 * Address types:
 *
	struct kvm_memory_slot *memslot;
};

struct gfn_to_pfn_cache {
	u64 generation;
	gfn_t gfn;
	kvm_pfn_t pfn;
	bool dirty;
};
