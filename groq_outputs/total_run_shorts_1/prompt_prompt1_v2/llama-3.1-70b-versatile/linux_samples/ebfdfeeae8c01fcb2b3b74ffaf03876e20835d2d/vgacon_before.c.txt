VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds memory access and potential integer overflow in pointer arithmetic.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a loop that copies data from one memory location to another. However, the calculation of the source memory address `p` using `t * c->vc_size_row` without proper bounds checking could lead to an out-of-bounds memory access. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the `count` variable is within acceptable limits, potentially causing an integer overflow when `count--` is executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Perform bounds checking on the `t` variable to ensure that the multiplication result does not exceed the maximum allowed value for the memory address.
2. Verify that `c->vc_origin`, `c->vc_size_row`, and `count` are properly initialized and within acceptable limits.
3. Use size_t or uintptr_t for pointer arithmetic calculations to avoid potential integer overflows.
4. Consider using a safer method for copying data, such as using `memcpy` or `memmove` with bounds checking.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	p = (void *) (c->vc_origin + t * c->vc_size_row);

	while (count--) {
		scr_memcpyw(vgacon_scrollback_cur->data +
			    vgacon_scrollback_cur->tail,
			    p, c->vc_size_row);
