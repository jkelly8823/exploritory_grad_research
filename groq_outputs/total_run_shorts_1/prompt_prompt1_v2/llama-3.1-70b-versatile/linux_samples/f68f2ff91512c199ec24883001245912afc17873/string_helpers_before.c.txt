VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code does not properly validate the input to the `pr_emerg` function call, which can lead to a format string vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `pr_emerg` function is used to print an emergency message to the kernel log. However, it uses a non-constant format string, which is derived from the `name` parameter passed to the `fortify_panic` function. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers into the log message, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or information leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the format string passed to `pr_emerg` should be made constant to prevent format string injection. One way to do this is to use a string that does not include any format specifiers. Here's an updated version of the code:
```c
void fortify_panic(const char *name)
{
    char msg[256];
    snprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), "detected buffer overflow in %s\n", name);
    pr_emerg("%s", msg);
    BUG();
}
```
Alternatively, you can also use a format string that only includes format specifiers for the literal `%s` and nothing else:
```c
void fortify_panic(const char *name)
{
    pr_emerg("detected buffer overflow in '%s'\n", name);
    BUG();
}
```
Both of these changes prevent the `name` variable from controlling the format string, mitigating the format string vulnerability.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
EXPORT_SYMBOL(memcpy_and_pad);

#ifdef CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE
void fortify_panic(const char *name)
{
    pr_emerg("detected buffer overflow in %s\n", name);
    BUG();
```
