VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a synchronization issue due to a locking problem. The `wait_woken` function does not guarantee the state of the `wait` object after it is called, which can lead to incorrect behavior when used in combination with `signal_pending` function.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, after calling `wait_woken`, the `wait` object's state is not guaranteed. However, if `signal_pending` returns true directly after, it indicates a potential for inconsistent behavior, as signal_pending checks may not be atomic with the `wait_woken` calls. Additionally, after `add_wait_queue` is called and before `remove_wait_queue` is called, there is a chance that the wait queue can be spuriously signaled or another thread is about to signal the queue right before it is removed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using `wait_event_interruptible_timeout` or similar `wait_event` convenience functions. This will wait until the `events->wait_queue` is signaled, handle timeout, spurious wakeups, and interruptions more robustly. Additionally, instead of rolling your own wait queue handling, leverage existing sync primitives that are more robust and handle edge cases:

```c
wait_event_interruptible_timeout(events->wait_queue, dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv, events), DVBTIMEOUT);
if(signal_pending(current))
    return -ERESTARTSYS;
``` 

Also, use `wait_event_idle` or `wait_event_timeout` instead of `wait_event_interruptible` if it's not necessary to handle user interruptibles.

		add_wait_queue(&events->wait_queue, &wait);
		while (!dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv, events)) {
			wait_woken(&wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, 0);
			if (signal_pending(current)) {
				ret = -ERESTARTSYS;
				break;
			}
		}
		remove_wait_queue(&events->wait_queue, &wait);
		if (ret < 0)
			return ret;
