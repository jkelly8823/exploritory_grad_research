VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a simple definition of an extern function `netdev_info` and a conditional definition of a macro `netdev_dbg`. There are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this code.

The `__attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));` part is a GCC attribute that indicates the function takes a `const char *` format string as its second argument, and allows the compiler to perform format string checking.

The conditional definition of `netdev_dbg` is also properly formatted and handled, with no apparent security concerns.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as the code snippet appears to be secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
extern int netdev_info(const struct net_device *dev, const char *format, ...)
	__attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));

#if defined(DEBUG)
#define netdev_dbg(__dev, format, args...)			\
	netdev_printk(KERN_DEBUG, __dev, format, ##args)
#elif defined(CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG)
```
