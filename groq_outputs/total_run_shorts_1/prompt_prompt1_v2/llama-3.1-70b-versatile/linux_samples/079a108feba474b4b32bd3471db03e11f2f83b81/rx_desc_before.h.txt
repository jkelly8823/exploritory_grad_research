VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is a simple definition of a bit flag (FW_RX_DESC_UDP) and a packed struct (fw_rx_desc_hl). There are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code, such as buffer overflows, unvalidated user input, or memory leaks. The use of a packed struct can potentially be an issue if the alignment requirements of the system are not properly considered, but given the lack of surrounding code and context, it is not clear if this is the case.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
#define FW_RX_DESC_UDP              (1 << 6)

struct fw_rx_desc_hl {
	u8 info0;
	u8 version;
	u8 len;
	u8 flags;
} __packed;
