VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability present in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is relatively simple and involves dereferencing a pointer (`fw_desc`) and accessing its member variable (`len`). It also includes a comment discussing a limitation of the code. This snippet does not perform any operation that could lead to a memory-related vulnerability, and it does not appear to be interacting with untrusted user data in any way.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
fw_desc = &rx->fw_desc;
rx_desc_len = fw_desc->len;

/* I have not yet seen any case where num_mpdu_ranges > 1.
* qcacld does not seem handle that case either, so we introduce the
* same limitiation here as well.
*/
```
