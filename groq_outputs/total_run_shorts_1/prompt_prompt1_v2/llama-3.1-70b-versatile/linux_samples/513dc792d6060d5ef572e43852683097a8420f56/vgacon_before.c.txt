VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
None

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is a function definition for `vgacon_resize`, which appears to be part of a VGA console driver. This function takes in parameters related to screen dimensions and font height. The provided code checks for potential invalid input conditions (e.g., width not being a multiple of 2, width exceeding original video columns, height exceeding calculated video lines). However, this function does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or insecure data handling. Note that this assessment is based solely on this snippet and does not consider potential vulnerabilities in the surrounding code.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
 None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int vgacon_resize(struct vc_data *c, unsigned int width,
			 unsigned int height, unsigned int user)
{
	if (width % 2 || width > screen_info.orig_video_cols ||
	    height > (screen_info.orig_video_lines * vga_default_font_height)/
	    c->vc_font.height)
		/* let svgatextmode tinker with video timings and */
```
