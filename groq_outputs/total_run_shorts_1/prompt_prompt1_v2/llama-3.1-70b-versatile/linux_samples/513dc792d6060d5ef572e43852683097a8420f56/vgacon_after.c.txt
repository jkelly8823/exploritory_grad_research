VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, an integer overflow vulnerability has been identified on lines 3-4. The code multiplies three unsigned integers together without validating that the operation will not overflow. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior and unexpected results. Specifically, the calculation `(width << 1) * height` could exceed the maximum limit allowed by the `unsigned int` data type, causing an integer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a larger data type that can accommodate the product of the three variables, such as `uint64_t`. Additionally, the result of the multiplication operation should be checked against the maximum limit before the comparison operation. Here's an example of how you could implement this:

```c
uint64_t result = (uint64_t)(width << 1) * height;
if (result > vga_vram_size)
    return -EINVAL;
```

Alternatively, the code could also use a checked multiplication function that checks for potential overflows before performing the multiplication. This will provide a safer and more reliable way of handling multiplications of integers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int vgacon_resize(struct vc_data *c, unsigned int width,
			 unsigned int height, unsigned int user)
{
	if ((width << 1) * height > vga_vram_size)
		return -EINVAL;

	if (width % 2 || width > screen_info.orig_video_cols ||
	    height > (screen_info.orig_video_lines * vga_default_font_height)/
	    c->vc_font.height)
