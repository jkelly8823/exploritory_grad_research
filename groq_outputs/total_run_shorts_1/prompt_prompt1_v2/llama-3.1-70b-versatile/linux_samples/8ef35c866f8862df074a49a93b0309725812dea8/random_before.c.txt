VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability appears to be related to a kernel information disclosure issue. The line `pr_notice("random: crng init done\n");` is vulnerable.

EXPLANATION:
This warning was generated due to a possible information disclosure. The line `pr_notice("random: crng init done\n");` outputs a string that appears to be directly displaying sensitive information regarding the initialization status of the CRNG (Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator). The event this log message describes could potentially be used by an attacker to fingerprint or infer configuration of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of outputting a message, this initialization event could be logged securely, accessible to authorized personnel. Alternatively, consider suppressing these logs when they can be made to represent a problem to your network since knowledge about system status can be determined by seeing the output. It's good to think about this type of output going into the logs when we choose to output directly system run-time issue that has been handled that's being used or would be visible.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
crng->init_time = jiffies - CRNG_RESEED_INTERVAL - 1;
}

/*
 * crng_fast_load() can be called by code in the interrupt service
 * path.  So we can't afford to dilly-dally.
 */
spin_unlock_irqrestore(&primary_crng.lock, flags);
if (crng == &primary_crng && crng_init < 2) {
	invalidate_batched_entropy();
	crng_init = 2;
	process_random_ready_list();
	wake_up_interruptible(&crng_init_wait);
	pr_notice("random: crng init done\n");
