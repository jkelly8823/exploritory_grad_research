VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code does not check if the returned node from `fdt_next_node` is a negative value that represents an error other than the end of the node list.

EXPLANATION:
The function `fdt_next_node` returns the offset of the next node in the device tree, or a negative `FDT_ERR_*` error code. However, the code only checks if the returned offset is less than zero, but it does not distinguish between the different possible error codes. This means that if `fdt_next_node` returns an error code that indicates an error other than the end of the node list, the code will incorrectly assume that it has reached the end of the list.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should check the specific error codes returned by `fdt_next_node` to handle errors properly. It should at least check for error codes that indicate a fatal error, such as `FDT_ERR_BADPHANDLE`, `FDT_ERR_BADSTATE`, or `FDT_ERR_BADSTRUCTURE`. The corrected code could look like this:
```c
node = fdt_next_node(fdt, prev, NULL);
if (node < 0) {
    if (node == -FDT_ERRNotFoundException) {
        // Handle end of node list
    } else {
        // Handle other errors
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	 */
	prev = 0;
	for (;;) {
		const char *type, *name;
		int len;

		node = fdt_next_node(fdt, prev, NULL);
		if (node < 0)
```
