VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uncontrolled Loop and Potential Null Pointer Dereference

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains an uncontrolled loop as it uses a `for (;;)` loop which will continue indefinitely unless an explicit break statement is encountered. However, the loop will exit only when the `node` value becomes -1.

Moreover, the code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference in case `fdt_next_node` function returns -1 and sets the `node` to -1 but still uses it before checking for the return value.

Additionally, this code does not handle potential failures or errors returned by the `fdt_next_node` function which could lead to further vulnerabilities or issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a conditional loop instead of an uncontrolled loop for better readability and maintainability.
Check the return value of `fdt_next_node` immediately and handle any possible errors. 
Also, consider adding error checking code to handle any potential null pointer dereference.

Example of how it can be modified to handle potential errors and edge cases.

```c
prev = 0;
node = fdt_next_node(fdt, prev, NULL);
while (node >= 0) {
    if (fdt_next_node(fdt, prev, NULL) < 0) {
        // handle error case
    }
    // proceed with your code here
}
```
This example assumes `fdt_next_node` is supposed to retrieve a node and if it's successful, it will retrieve the next node in the loop. 
Each iteration checks the return value to exit the loop if an error occurs.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	 */
	prev = 0;
	for (;;) {
		const char *type;
		int len;

		node = fdt_next_node(fdt, prev, NULL);
		if (node < 0)
```
