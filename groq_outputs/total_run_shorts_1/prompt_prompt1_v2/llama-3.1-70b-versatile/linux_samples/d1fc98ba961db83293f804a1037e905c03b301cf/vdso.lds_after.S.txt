VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of a vDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) implementation. It consists of a preprocessor directive, an include statement, and a comment. After analyzing the code, I did not identify any vulnerabilities. The code is relatively simple and does not involve any user input or dynamic memory management, which reduces the risk of security breaches.
