VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbounded Comparative Operation
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in lines 6-7, where the strcmp() function is used to compare the contents of the uname variable with constant strings. The issue arises because the uname variable is not bounds-checked or sanitised before being passed to the strcmp() function. This can potentially lead to a buffer overflow or an unbounded comparative operation, where the function compares more data than initially intended. Additionally, the strcmp() function does not handle NULL-terminated strings properly if the input string is too long, which can result in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the strcmp() function by checking if the uname variable is NULL before calling the function.
2. Use strnlen() or a similar function to restrict the length of the input string.
3. Consider using safer alternatives like strncmp_s() or explicit bounds checking on the input strings.
4. Consider specifying the buffer size when defining the uname variable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
.Override of firmware DTB parsing code
.configure_callback(firmware_parse_dtb_callback, int depth, void *data)
{
	struct param_info *info = data;
	const void *prop;
	void *dest;
	u64 val;
	int i, len;

	if (depth != 1 ||
	    (strcmp(uname, "chosen") != 0 && strcmp(uname, "chosen@0") != 0))
		return 0;
