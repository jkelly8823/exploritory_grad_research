VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 123-129
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow or null pointer dereference due to insufficient validation of the symbol table entries.
EXPLANATION:
In the code, the function `GOFUNC` is iterating over the symbol table entries, and for each entry, it is checking if the symbol name matches a required symbol. However, it is not validating if the symbol offset and size are within the bounds of the symbol table before accessing them.

Specifically, in the code snippet:

```c
Elf_Sym *sym = addr + GET_LE(&symtab_hdr->sh_offset) + GET_LE(&symtab_hdr->sh_entsize) * i;
const char *name = addr + GET_LE(&strtab_hdr->sh_offset) + GET_LE(&sym->st_name);
```

The code is not checking if the offset `GET_LE(&symtab_hdr->sh_offset)` and size `GET_LE(&symtab_hdr->sh_entsize)` are within the bounds of the symbol table before accessing the symbol entries. This can lead to a buffer overflow or null pointer dereference if the symbol table is corrupted or has invalid entries.

Additionally, the code is not validating if `strtab_hdr` is null before accessing its offset and size. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if `strtab_hdr` is null.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the code should validate the symbol table entries and the `strtab_hdr` before accessing them. The following checks should be added:

```c
if (symtab_hdr == NULL || strtab_hdr == NULL) {
    fail("Invalid symbol table or string table header\n");
}

if (i >= GET_LE(&symtab_hdr->sh_size) / GET_LE(&symtab_hdr->sh_entsize)) {
    fail("Symbol table index out of bounds\n");
}

if (GET_LE(&sym->st_name) >= GET_LE(&strtab_hdr->sh_size)) {
    fail("String table index out of bounds\n");
}
```

These checks should be added before accessing the symbol and string table entries.
