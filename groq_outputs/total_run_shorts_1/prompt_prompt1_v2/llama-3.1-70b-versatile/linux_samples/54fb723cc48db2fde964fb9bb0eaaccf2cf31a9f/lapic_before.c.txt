VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7, 13-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `kvm_lapic_sync_from_vapic` and `kvm_lapic_set_vapic_addr` functions.

EXPLANATION:
In both functions, the code uses `offset_in_page(vcpu->arch.apic->vapic_addr)` without proper bounds checking. Additionally, in `kvm_lapic_set_vapic_addr`, the new address is stored directly without any validation. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow when writing data to the `vapic` buffer.

The vulnerability occurs when `vcpu->arch.apic->vapic_addr` is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to code execution or data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

* Validate the `vapic_addr` before using it to calculate the offset in the page.
* Check if the calculated offset is within the bounds of the `vapic` buffer to prevent potential overflows.
* Use safer alternatives to `kmap_atomic` and `kunmap_atomic` such as `kmap` and `kunmap` if possible.
* Consider using address space layout randomization (ASLR) to make the location of the `vapic` buffer more unpredictable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void kvm_lapic_sync_from_vapic(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
    ...
    vapic = kmap_atomic(vcpu->arch.apic->vapic_page);
    data = *(u32 *)(vapic + offset_in_page(vcpu->arch.apic->vapic_addr));
    kunmap_atomic(vapic);
    ...
}

void kvm_lapic_set_vapic_addr(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, gpa_t vapic_addr)
{
    vcpu->arch.apic->vapic_addr = vapic_addr;
    ...
}
```
