VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No potential vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a configuration block for the Linux kernel or a similar project. It checks if the compiler supports the -frandomize-layout-seed-file option. The snippet does not contain any user input, command execution, or memory access patterns that could potentially lead to common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, path traversal, or SQL injection.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code appears to be well-structured and safe. However, it's essential to consider the security implications of the -frandomize-layout-seed-file option and its potential interaction with other system components. Additionally, make sure to follow best practices for secure coding and kernel configuration.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	# Randstruct was first added in Clang 15, but it isn't safe to use until
	# Clang 16 due to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60349
