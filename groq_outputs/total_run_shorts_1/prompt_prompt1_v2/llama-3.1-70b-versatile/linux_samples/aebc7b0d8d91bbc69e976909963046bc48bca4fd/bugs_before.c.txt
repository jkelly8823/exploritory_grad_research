VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a Linux kernel testing module, specifically the `lkdtm` (Linux Kernel Dump Test Module) module, which is used to test and trigger certain error conditions in the kernel. The code checks for potential corruptions in linked list operations (`list_add` and `list_del`) and checks if debug configurations are set (`pr_expected_config(CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST)`). 

The code is not vulnerable as it only contains debug error handling and reporting mechanisms. The potential corruptions detected by this code are symptoms of issues elsewhere in the kernel, and this code is designed to detect and report those symptoms.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as this code is not vulnerable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
	pr_err("Overwrite did not happen, but no BUG?!\n");
else {
	pr_err("list_add() corruption not detected!\n");
	pr_expected_config(CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST);
}
}

static void lkdtm_CORRUPT_LIST_DEL(void)
	pr_err("Overwrite did not happen, but no BUG?!\n");
else {
	pr_err("list_del() corruption not detected!\n");
	pr_expected_config(CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST);
}
}

/* Test that VMAP_STACK is actually allocating with a leading guard page */
