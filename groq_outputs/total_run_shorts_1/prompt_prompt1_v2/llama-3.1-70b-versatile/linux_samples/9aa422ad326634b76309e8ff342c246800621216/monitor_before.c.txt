VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a portion of a function responsible for validating a domain record. It checks the length of the received data (`dlen`) against the expected lengths of a domain record for two different scenarios: when there are no members (`arrv_dom, 0`) and when there is a new member (`arrv_dom, new_member_cnt`). If the lengths do not match, the function returns immediately.

This code snippet does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or unchecked user input. The logic is straightforward and error checking is performed to ensure the data length matches the expected lengths.

Since the code snippet is isolated from the rest of the codebase, there might be potential issues related to the context in which this code is used. However, based solely on the provided code, no vulnerabilities were detected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
state->probing = false;

/* Sanity check received domain record */
if (dlen < dom_rec_len(arrv_dom, 0))
    return;
if (dlen != dom_rec_len(arrv_dom, new_member_cnt))
    return;
```
