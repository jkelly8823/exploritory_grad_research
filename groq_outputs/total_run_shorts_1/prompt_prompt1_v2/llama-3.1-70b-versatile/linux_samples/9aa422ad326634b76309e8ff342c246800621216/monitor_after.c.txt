VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be a portion of a larger function that handles domain records. The code performs sanity checks to ensure certain conditions are met before continuing. The checks include verifying the new member count does not exceed the maximum allowed and verifying the domain record length against expected values.

The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as unvalidated user input, buffer overflows, or unchecked memory allocations. The use of early returns also suggests that the function tries to minimize the execution path and avoid potential failures.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
state->probing = false;

/* Sanity check received domain record */
if (new_member_cnt > MAX_MON_DOMAIN)
    return;
if (dlen < dom_rec_len(arrv_dom, 0))
    return;
if (dlen != dom_rec_len(arrv_dom, new_member_cnt))
    return;
```
