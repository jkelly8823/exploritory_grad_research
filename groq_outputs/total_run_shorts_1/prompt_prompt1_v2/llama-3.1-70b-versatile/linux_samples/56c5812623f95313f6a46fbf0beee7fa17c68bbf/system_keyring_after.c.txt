VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that checks the validity of a PKCS#7 platform key. It performs various checks, including checking if the key is on a revocation list and if it can be validated against a set of trusted keys. However, I couldn't identify any potential vulnerabilities in the snippet.

However, there are a few potential issues that are worth noting:

- The code uses `goto` statements, which can be considered bad practice in many cases. However, in this specific context, it doesn't seem to introduce any security vulnerabilities.
- The code assumes that the `is_key_on_revocation_list` and `pkcs7_validate_trust` functions behave correctly and return the expected error codes. If these functions have bugs or vulnerabilities, they could potentially compromise the security of the system. However, without seeing the implementation of these functions, it's impossible to assess their security.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, based on the provided code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
		pr_devel("PKCS#7 platform keyring is not available\n");
		goto error;
	}

	ret = is_key_on_revocation_list(pkcs7);
	if (ret != -ENOKEY) {
		pr_devel("PKCS#7 platform key is on revocation list\n");
		goto error;
	}
}
	ret = pkcs7_validate_trust(pkcs7, trusted_keys);
	if (ret < 0) {
		if (ret == -ENOKEY)
```
