VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet contains a possible NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the uefi_guidcmp function. 

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the uefi_guidcmp function is called with a pointer as its first argument. However, there is no validation to ensure that this pointer is not NULL before calling the function. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the 'sig_type' variable is NULL, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, the 'uefi_guidcmp' function is not a standard UEFI library function, it's likely a custom implementation, and its behavior on a NULL pointer is not defined. It is good practice to always validate function arguments to prevent such vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Before calling the uefi_guidcmp function, validate that the 'sig_type' variable is not NULL.

```c
if (sig_type != NULL) {
    if (efi_guidcmp(*sig_type, efi_cert_sha256_guid) == 0)
        return uefi_blacklist_binary;
} else {
    // handle NULL pointer error
}
```

Please note that without seeing the definition of the uefi_guidcmp function and the source of the 'sig_type' variable, it's difficult to provide a more detailed recommendation.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
uefi_blacklist_hash(source, data, len, "bin:", 4);
}

/*
 * Return the appropriate handler for particular signature list types found in
 * the UEFI db and MokListRT tables.
 */
    return uefi_blacklist_x509_tbs;
if (efi_guidcmp(*sig_type, efi_cert_sha256_guid) == 0)
    return uefi_blacklist_binary;
return 0;
}
