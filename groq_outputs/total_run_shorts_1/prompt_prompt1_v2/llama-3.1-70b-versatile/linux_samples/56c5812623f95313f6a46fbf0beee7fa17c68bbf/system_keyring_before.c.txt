VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate error handling in:pkcs7_validate_trust() call

EXPLANATION:
The pkcs7_validate_trust() function call is made with minimal error checking. The only error code explicitly checked is -ENOKEY, but there could be other potential error codes that are not being handled. This could potentially leave the code in an undefined state or crash if an unexpected error occurs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to properly check for all possible error codes returned by the pkcs7_validate_trust() function and handle each accordingly. Additionally, the error message should be updated to include the specific error code to aid in debugging.

```
// Proposed fix: Check for all possible error codes
ret = pkcs7_validate_trust(pkcs7, trusted_keys);
if (ret < 0) {
    pr_devel("Error validating trust: %d\n", ret);
    switch (ret) {
        case -ENOKEY:
            // existing error handling here
        default:
            pr_devel("Unexpected error validating trust: %d\n", ret);
            // add error handling for unexpected errors here
    }
    goto error;
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
pr_devel("PKCS#7 platform keyring is not available\n");
goto error;
}
}
ret = pkcs7_validate_trust(pkcs7, trusted_keys);
if (ret < 0) {
    if (ret == -ENOKEY)
```
