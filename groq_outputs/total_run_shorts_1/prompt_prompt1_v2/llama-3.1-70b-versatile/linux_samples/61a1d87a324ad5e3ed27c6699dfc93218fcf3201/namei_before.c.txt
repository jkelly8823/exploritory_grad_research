VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is that sensitive information about the file system (i_size) might be logged in an error message.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `ext4_error_inode` function to log an error message with debug-level information about an inconsistency in the directory block. This error message is passed the value of `inode->i_size` which could potentially contain sensitive information. In certain scenarios, such as logging to an insecure location or logging in a debug environment where logs might be exposed, this could potentially leak sensitive file system information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Mask or remove the sensitive `inode->i_size` value from the error message. Consider logging only the relevant, non-sensitive information. For example:

```c
ext4_error_inode(inode, func, line, block,
             "Attempting to read directory block (%u) that is past i_size",
             block);
```

Also, ensure that error messages are handled and logged securely according to your specific use case.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
struct ext4_dir_entry *dirent;
int is_dx_block = 0;

if (block >= inode->i_size) {
	ext4_error_inode(inode, func, line, block,
	       "Attempting to read directory block (%u) that is past i_size (%llu)",
	       block, inode->i_size);
	return ERR_PTR(-EFSCORRUPTED);
```
