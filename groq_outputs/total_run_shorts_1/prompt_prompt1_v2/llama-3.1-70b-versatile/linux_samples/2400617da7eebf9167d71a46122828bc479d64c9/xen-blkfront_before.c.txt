VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use after free vulnerability in indirect grant management

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, we see that when `info->feature_persistent` is `false`, a gref is assigned to a page in `gnt_list_entry->gref = gnttab_claim_grant_reference(gref_head);`. Later, in the cleanup loop, we see that `list_for_each_entry_safe(indirect_page, n, &rinfo->indirect_pages, lru)` is used to free pages in `&rinfo->indirect_pages`. However, when we reach the line `BUG_ON(gnt_list_entry->gref == -ENOSPC);`, if `gnt_list_entry->gref` indeed equals `-ENOSPC`, we see that `goto out_of_memory` is executed. Following the code, we notice that after `out_of_memory`, we have `list_for_each_entry_safe(gnt_list_entry, n, &rinfo->grants, node)` which frees `gnt_list_entry->page`. 

However, right above `list_for_each_entry_safe(gnt_list_entry, n, &rinfo->grants, node)`, we have `if (info->feature_persistent) __free_page(granted_page);` and then `kfree(gnt_list_entry);`. Here we see a potential problem. If `info->feature_persistent` is `false`, we still have `kfree(gnt_list_entry)`, but we do not free `granted_page`. Then, we eventually reach the line `gnt_list_entry->gref = gnttab_claim_grant_reference(gref_head);`, which will lead to a use-after-free since we freed `gnt_list_entry`, but we still use its pointer. Hence, the code is vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
We recommend adding `__free_page(granted_page)` before `kfree(gnt_list_entry)` to fix the use-after-free vulnerability when `info->feature_persistent` is `false`. Here's the corrected code:
```c
if (info->feature_persistent) {
    granted_page = alloc_page(GFP_NOIO | __GFP_ZERO);
    if (!granted_page) {
        kfree(gnt_list_entry);
        goto out_of_memory;
    }
    ...
} else {
    kfree(gnt_list_entry);
    if (granted_page != NULL) {
        __free_page(granted_page);
    }
    ...
}
```
Also we should check in xenbus_read_unsigned function that the max-ring-page-order value read is not zero to prevent potential integer overflow in line 29 'info->nr_ring_pages = 1 << ring_page_order;'.
