VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
In Java, strings created with the `new` keyword are not interned and result in multiple objects even if the strings have the same value. Therefore, using the `==` operator to compare strings may not always produce the expected results.

EXPLANATION:
The code creates two `String` objects, `str1` and `str2`, using the `new` keyword. However, it then uses the `==` operator to compare these objects. In Java, the `==` operator compares the memory locations of the objects, not their actual values. Since `str1` and `str2` are separate objects, even though they have the same value, the `==` operator will always return `false`, causing the message to never be printed. 

This vulnerability can lead to unexpected behavior in programs that rely on string comparisons.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `equals()` method instead of the `==` operator to compare the values of the strings. Additionally, if possible, consider using literals or the `intern()` method to ensure that strings are interned and can be safely compared using the `==` operator.

Corrected code:
```javascript
String str1 = "Hello"; // Using literals to ensure string is interned
String str2 = "Hello";
if (str1.equals(str2)) {  // Using equals() method to compare string values
    System.out.println("str1 equals str2");
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");
if (str1 == str2) {
    System.out.println("str1 == str2");
}
```
