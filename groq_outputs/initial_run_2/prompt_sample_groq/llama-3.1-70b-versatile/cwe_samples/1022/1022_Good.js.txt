VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to set the opener property on a newly opened window to null, opening the door to phishing attacks or potential malware installations.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the window.opener property is set to null in the newly opened window. This is a problem because an attacker could set the location of the opened window to a malicious site before setting the opener property to null. The user may then believe that the malicious site was opened by the original site, when in reality it is being opened by a malicious link. 

Furthermore,  by using `window.open` to open a site that an attacker controls, attackers may attempt phishing scams, forcing users into giving them personal information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
One possible fix for this vulnerability would involve using more restrictive attribute directives on links via Content Security Policy.  Here's a quick example: doing this might improve things up front and be simpler than removing some features of your site.



Another alternative is to use another methodology of information communication on another channel so as not to have any resource exposed on another domain outside of your firm. 

If instead, specifically allowing it as given and you don't choose to have the window popups for your users' experience so modifying it so as to remove this functionality such as replacing those functions for use to internal page windows:  

To clarify, one potential fix actually involves considering refactoring this code snippet, such that similar functionality exists solely and internally, within the confines of your particular website domain where setting openings based in that exampled code wouldn't, under nearly all known circumstances, represent a possible security threat.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");newWindow.opener = null;
