VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be securely handling a session ID by storing it in a secure cookie with the HttpOnly flag set to true. This prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie and reduces the risk of session ID theft through XSS attacks. However, it does not set the Secure flag, which is potentially problematic if the session ID is not transmitted over HTTPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider adding the Secure flag to the cookie to ensure it is only transmitted over HTTPS. This can be done by calling c.setSecure(true) after setting the HttpOnly flag.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
c.setHttpOnly(true);
response.addCookie(c);
```
