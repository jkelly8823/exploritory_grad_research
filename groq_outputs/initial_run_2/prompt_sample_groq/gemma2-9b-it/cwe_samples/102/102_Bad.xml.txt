VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate form declaration

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet exhibits a vulnerability due to the duplicate declaration of a form with the name "ProjectForm" within the `<formset>` tag.  

This duplication will likely cause issues during form processing as web frameworks typically expect unique identifiers for each form.  A single form with this name will be rendered, and the second instance will likely be ignored. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Change the name of the second `<form>` element to something unique, such as "SecondProjectForm", to avoid conflicts. 
- Identify the intended purpose of having two forms and refactor the code accordingly. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

```html
				   <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
				 
```
