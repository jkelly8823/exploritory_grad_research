VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet has a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  It opens a hyperlink with a URL that originates from an external source (`http://attacker-site.example.com`). An attacker could manipulate this URL to include malicious JavaScript code.

When a user clicks on this link, the browser will execute the malicious JavaScript code. This could allow the attacker to:

* Steal user session cookies
* Redirect the user to malicious websites
* Display harmful content on the user's screen
* Perform other actions on the user's behalf

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before embedding any user-supplied data into HTML, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters and scripts. There are libraries available in most programming languages that can assist with this.

2. **Encode Output:** Always encode data that is displayed in HTML to prevent it from being interpreted as code. For example, use HTML entities to escape characters like `<`, `>`, and `&`.

3. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to define which sources are allowed to load resources on your website. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by restricting the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.
