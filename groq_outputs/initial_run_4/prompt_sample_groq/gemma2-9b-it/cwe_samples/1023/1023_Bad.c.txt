VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded credentials and insecure password comparison

EXPLANATION:
The code contains several vulnerabilities:

* **Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-259):** The `username` and `password` variables are directly defined as hardcoded strings. This makes them easily discoverable and vulnerable to attackers. 
* **Insecure Password Comparison:** 
    * The code uses `strncmp` with  `strlen(inUser)` and `strlen(inPass)` to compare passwords. 
    *  `strlen` returns the length of the string, assuming the entire string has to be compared, this can lead to issues if passwords are shorter than the maximum allowed length.
    * Secure password comparison should use a consistent hashing algorithm to securely compare passwords, regardless of length.

* **Logging Sensitive Information:** The `logEvent` function logs authentication success and failure messages, potentially revealing information about successful login attempts and the usernames used.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Never Hardcode Credentials:**
   * Use environment variables, configuration files, or secure credential management systems to store sensitive information.

2. **Implement Secure Password Hashing:**
   * Use a strong, cryptographically secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to hash passwords before storing them. Compare incoming passwords with their hashed equivalents. 

3. **Salt Passwords:**
   * Add a unique "salt" value to each password before hashing to make password cracking more difficult.

4. **Limit Log Output:**
   * Avoid logging sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly. Log success/failure states generically or use anonymized identifiers.

5. **Use Random Initialization:** Use `rand()` or a cryptographically secure random number generator to initialize variables like usernames, especially in a multi-threaded environment.




ORIGINAL CODE:            
```c
/* Ignore CWE-259 (hard-coded password) and CWE-309 (use of password system for authentication) for this example. */
char *username = "admin";char *pass = "password";
int AuthenticateUser(char *inUser, char *inPass) {
  if (strncmp(username, inUser, strlen(inUser))) {
    logEvent("Auth failure of username using strlen of inUser");
    return(AUTH_FAIL);
  }
  if (! strncmp(pass, inPass, strlen(inPass))) {
    logEvent("Auth success of password using strlen of inUser");
    return(AUTH_SUCCESS);
  } else {
    logEvent("Auth fail of password using sizeof");
    return(AUTH_FAIL);
  }
}
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
  int authResult;
  if (argc < 3) {
    ExitError("Usage: Provide a username and password");
  }
  authResult = AuthenticateUser(argv[1], argv[2]);
  if (authResult == AUTH_SUCCESS) {
    DoAuthenticatedTask(argv[1]);
  } else {
    ExitError("Authentication failed");
  }
  
}
```
