VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential 

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `window.open()` to open a new window pointing to "http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html". If the URL provided is under attacker control, it could potentially contain malicious JavaScript code. When the new window loads, this malicious script could execute in the user's browser, leading to various attacks like stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or hijacking their session.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize User Input:**  If the URL is coming from user input, it's crucial to sanitize it thoroughly before using it in the `window.open()` function. Use a robust sanitization library or technique to remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters. 
* **Use a Whitelist Approach:** Instead of trying to sanitize all inputs, create a whitelist of allowed domains or URLs. Only allow the opening of windows pointing to these pre-approved destinations.
* **Consider Alternatives:**  If possible, explore alternative ways to achieve your desired functionality without directly opening new windows controlled by external sources.  



ORIGINAL CODE:

```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank"); 
```
