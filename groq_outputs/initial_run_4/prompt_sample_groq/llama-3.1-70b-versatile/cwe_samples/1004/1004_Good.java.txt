VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure implementation of session ID cookie.

EXPLANATION:
The code sets the `HttpOnly` flag on the session ID cookie but does not set the `Secure` flag. This means that the cookie will be transmitted in plain text over an insecure connection, leaving it vulnerable to interception by an attacker. This could allow an attacker to steal the session ID and gain unauthorized access to the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure the session ID cookie, you should set both the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. Here is the corrected code:

```java
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
c.setHttpOnly(true);
c.setSecure(true); // Add this line to set the Secure flag
response.addCookie(c);
```

Additionally, you may also consider setting the `SameSite` attribute on the cookie to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
c.setHttpOnly(true);
response.addCookie(c);
```
