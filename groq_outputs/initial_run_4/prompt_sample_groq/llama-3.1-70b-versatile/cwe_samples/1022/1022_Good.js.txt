VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a 'window.opener' issue. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to hijack the original window.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided uses the 'window.open' function to open a new window. The URL 'http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html' is hardcoded and could potentially be replaced by an attacker with a malicious site. Additionally, the 'newWindow.opener' property is set to null. While this may seem like an attempt to close the communication channel, it's crucial to consider the context in which it is used.

A common pattern to exploit this vulnerability is when an untrusted page is opened via 'window.open'. If the page changes the 'window.opener' reference to null, this untrusted page can now load arbitrary content in the parent document by navigating this newly 'null' page to the target resource.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the URL, consider using a parameterized URL. It is also essential to validate and sanitize any input before using it. Implement Content Security Policy to control resources that can be loaded. Better yet, consider using other APIs such as "noopener" (along with the "noreferrer" to restrict referring information):

```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank", 'noopener,noreferrer');
newWindow.opener = null;
```

However, be aware that this is still vulnerable to the mentioned issue due to how assigning 'null' overwrites any previous attributes defining the origin to 'noopener'.

The use of "noopener" prevents an attacker from conducting cross-origin attacks by removing 'window.opener' attribute access and referring requests information and then having the malicious page overwrite 'null', as the "noopener" parameter does more than merely change the linking attribute. Always secure your origin and the attributes accessing it.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");newWindow.opener = null;
```
