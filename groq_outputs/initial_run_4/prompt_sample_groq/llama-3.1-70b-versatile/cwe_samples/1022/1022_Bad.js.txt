VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Unsanitized "window.open" Call.

EXPLANATION:
The `window.open` function is used to open a new window with a specified URL. However, in this case, the URL is hardcoded with a value that may be an attacker-controlled webpage. This can lead to a phishing attack where an attacker can control the content of the new window, potentially leading to user exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the URL, consider using a user-specific or trusted URL that is sanitized to prevent phishing attacks. Additionally, use the `noopener` and `noreferrer` parameters with `_blank` to prevent the new tab from having access to the origin page's tab.

```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("https://example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank", 'noopener noreferrer');
```
Alternatively, if you must allow dynamic URLs, consider validating and sanitizing them before passing them to `window.open`.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
```
