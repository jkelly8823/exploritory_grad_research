VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via format string injection.
EXPLANATION:
The code performs input validation using a regular expression, but it does not properly sanitize the inputs before using them in a format string. The `prompt` variable is constructed using user-provided inputs `arg1` and `arg2` with the `.format()` method, which does not prevent code injection. An attacker could craft malicious input strings that, when formatted into the prompt, could execute arbitrary code or inject malicious content into the application's output.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, the code should properly escape any user-provided input before formatting it into the prompt. This can be achieved by using the `.format()` method with explicit string conversion, such as `str(arg1)` and `str(arg2)`, to prevent code injection. Alternatively, consider using f-strings or the `string.Template` class to avoid format string injection vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
cweRegex = re.compile("^CWE-\d+$")
match1 = cweRegex.search(arg1)
match2 = cweRegex.search(arg2)
if match1 is None or match2 is None:
    # throw exception, generate error, etc.
prompt = "Explain the difference between {} and {}".format(arg1, arg2)
...```

Note: Depending on the specific requirements and use case, additional recommendations may include input validation and sanitization, secure coding practices, and security frameworks or libraries to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
