VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability due to the concatenation of user-controlled input into a shell command.

EXPLANATION:
The `do_listing` function creates a shell command by concatenating the `/bin/ls -l` command with the `$fname` argument, which is obtained from the `GetArgument` function. This command is then executed using the `system` function. However, if the `$fname` argument contains malicious input, such as shell metacharacters or escape sequences, it could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands. The `validate_name` function attempts to validate the filename, but its regular expression is not sufficient to prevent all possible malicious input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a safer method of executing the command, such as using the `exec` function with a list of arguments instead of a single string. Additionally, the `validate_name` function should be modified to use a stronger validation mechanism, such as checking for a valid file path or using a whitelist of allowed characters. Here's an example of how the `do_listing` function could be modified:

```perl
sub do_listing {
  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {
    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;
  }
  exec('/bin/ls', '-l', $fname);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


```perl
my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
do_listing($arg);


sub do_listing {

  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {

    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;

  }
  # build command
  my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
  system($cmd);

}

sub validate_name {

  my($name) = @_;
  if ($name =~ /^[\w\-]+$/) {

    return(1);

  }
  else {

    return(0);

  }

}
```
