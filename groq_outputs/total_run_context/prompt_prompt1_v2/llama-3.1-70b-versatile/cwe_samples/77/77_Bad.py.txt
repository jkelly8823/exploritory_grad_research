VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to potential command injection attacks due to directly formatting user-supplied input into a prompt that may be executed by the `invokeChatbot` function. Although it's unclear what the `invokeChatbot` function does, it seems like it might be executing the prompt in some way.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes user input `arg1` and `arg2` and directly formats them into a prompt without proper sanitization or validation. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if the `invokeChatbot` function executes the prompt in an insecure manner. 

Without knowing the exact implementation of `invokeChatbot`, it's hard to know the full scope of the vulnerability, but in general, this type of pattern (formatting user input into a string that's then executed) can be open to security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper input validation to ensure that `arg1` and `arg2` are safe for use in the prompt. This might involve checking the input values against an allowlist of safe values.
2. Avoid directly formatting user-supplied input into a prompt that's executed by the `invokeChatbot` function.
3. If the `invokeChatbot` function executes the prompt in a way that's vulnerable to command injection attacks, consider modifying it to use a safer approach (e.g., executing it in a sandboxed environment).
4. Consider using a safer way to format strings, such as using positional arguments with the `format` method.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
prompt = "Explain the difference between {} and {}".format(arg1, arg2)
result = invokeChatbot(prompt)
resultHTML = encodeForHTML(result)
print resultHTML
```
