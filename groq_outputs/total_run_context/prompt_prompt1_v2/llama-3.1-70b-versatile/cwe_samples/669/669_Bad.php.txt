VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. 

EXPLANATION:
The function `authenticate($username,$password)` is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks because it directly concatenates user-provided input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. The variables `$username` and `$password` are not escaped or validated, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:
1. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent user input from being executed as SQL code. This can be achieved with PHP's MySQLi or PDO extensions.
2. Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent any malicious data from being inserted into the database.

Here's an example of how the code can be rewritten to use prepared statements:

```php
// assume the password is already encrypted, avoiding CWE-312

// Using MySQLi extension
function authenticate($username,$password){
    include("http://external.example.com/dbInfo.php");
    
    $conn = new mysqli($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname);
    
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    
    $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=?");
    $stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
    
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    
    if($result->num_rows == 1) {
        $conn->close();
        return true;
    }else{
        $conn->close();
        return false;
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
//assume the password is already encrypted, avoiding CWE-312

function authenticate($username,$password){
    include("http://external.example.com/dbInfo.php");
    
    //dbInfo.php makes $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname available
    mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass) or die ('Error connecting to mysql');mysql_select_db($dbname);$query = 'Select * from users where username='.$username.' And password='.$password;$result = mysql_query($query);
    if(mysql_numrows($result) == 1){mysql_close();return true;}else{mysql_close();return false;}
}
```
