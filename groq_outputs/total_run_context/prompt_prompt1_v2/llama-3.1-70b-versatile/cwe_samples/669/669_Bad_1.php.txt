VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated and unsanitized user-controlled data is used to retrieve a user record, potentially exposing sensitive information. Moreover, user-controlled data is directly output in JSON format, which can lead to Authentication and Authorization bypass or JSON injection attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet accepts 'json', 'user' as input parameters via the HTTP GET method and assigns them to $json and $username variables. These unvalidated and unsanitized input parameters are directly used to retrieve user records and output sensitive information in both HTML and JSON formats.

The main concerns are:
- Unvalidated and unsanitized input parameters being used to retrieve sensitive user records.
- The getUserRecord function returns the entire user record including sensitive information, which is then output in JSON format.
- The 'email_address' field is specifically skipped when writing to the HTML page but is still included when the record is output in JSON format.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address the identified vulnerability:
- Validate and sanitize user input data before using it to retrieve user records.
- Consider using a whitelist of allowed fields to ensure only non-sensitive data is retrieved and output.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks before retrieving and outputting user records.
- Avoid directly outputting sensitive fields like 'email_address' in both HTML and JSON formats.
- Use a predefined schema or a library like JSend to standardize the JSON output format and avoid including sensitive fields.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
// API flag, output JSON if set
$json = $_GET['json']
$username = $_GET['user']
if(!$json){
   $record = getUserRecord($username);
   foreach($record as $fieldName => $fieldValue){
       if($fieldName == "email_address") {
      
            // skip displaying user emails
            continue;
        }else{writeToHtmlPage($fieldName,$fieldValue);}
   }
}else{$record = getUserRecord($username);echo json_encode($record);}
```
