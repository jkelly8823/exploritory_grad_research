VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the line where the script attempts to open a file for writing. The file is specified by the variable `$fileName`. Although the file name seems constant in this code snippet, it might not be the case in the larger codebase. 

If an attacker is able to control the value of `$fileName`, they can potentially overwrite any file on the system with arbitrary content. This can be done by manipulating the file path to point to a sensitive system file or config file. 

Moreover, the script sets the permissions of the file to `0777` regardless of whether it was able to write to it or not. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the server's file system.

However, there's another serious concern: an attacker might be able to inject malicious content into the file even if the filename is constant. This can happen if the `FormatCurrentTime()` or `IsHostAlive("cwe.mitre.org")` functions can be manipulated by the attacker to produce malicious output.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid arbitrary file writes by implementing proper input validation on the `$fileName` variable. Ensure the file path is correctly sanitized to prevent any sensitive information disclosure or code injection.
2. Limit the write permissions on the file and avoid setting the permissions to `0777`, which can make the file accessible and modifiable by everyone on the system.
3. Validate and sanitize any user-controlled or function-generated input before writing it to the file.
4. Ensure that error handling for file I/O operations is correctly implemented to prevent potential information disclosure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
$fileName = "secretFile.out";
if (-e $fileName) {chmod 0777, $fileName;}
my $outFH;if (! open($outFH, ">>$fileName")) {ExitError("Couldn't append to $fileName: $!");}my $dateString = FormatCurrentTime();my $status = IsHostAlive("cwe.mitre.org");print $outFH "$dateString cwe status: $status!\n";close($outFH);
```
