VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command injection vulnerability in Azure storage account update command.

EXPLANATION:
The Azure storage account update command appears to be vulnerable to command injection attacks due to the lack of proper input validation for the storage account and resource group names. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands if they are able to manipulate the input values. 

However, the specific issue here seems slightly different. This command is not being executed from code. It appears that this command is not being treated dynamically and its values don't seem to be coming from an untrusted source. It should however be evaluated for the impact of setting 'allow-blob-public-access' to 'true'.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Considering the context in which this command is being used, ensure that setting 'allow-blob-public-access' to 'true' does not inadvertently expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. Azure recommends 'allow-blob-public-access' be turned off unless blob public access is needed for your Azure storage account. 'allow-blob-public-access' should typically be set to 'false'.

Use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to update the storage account instead of setting it directly, and make sure that changes to this setting are assessed before actual implementation to your production environment.

If you're dynamically using values from untrusted sources to set the storage account or the resource group names, use parameterized commands to avoid injection vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access true
