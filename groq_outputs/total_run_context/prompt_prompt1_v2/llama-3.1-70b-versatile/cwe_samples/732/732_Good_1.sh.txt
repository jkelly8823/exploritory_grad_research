VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet contains a vulnerability related to permissions management in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the Google Cloud SDK (`gsutil`) command-line tool.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `gsutil iam ch` command to grant permission to all users (`-d allUsers`) and to all authenticated users (`-d allAuthenticatedUsers`) on a GCS bucket. By granting such broad permissions, the code increases the risk of unexpected and potentially malicious access to sensitive data stored in the bucket.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend the following:

* Limit permissions to the specific roles or service accounts that require access to the GCS bucket. This can be done by using the `gsutil iam ch` command with the `-d` flag followed by the specific role name, such as `-d roles/storage.objectViewer`.
* Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to implement a least-privilege access model, ensuring that each service account or role only has the permissions it needs to perform its designated function.
* Consider implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to improve granularity in permission management.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
```
