Insecure File Permissions

EXPLANATION:
The use of `chmod -R ugo+r DIRNAME` grants read permissions to all users (ugo) recursively to the contents of the directory DIRNAME. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, as it allows any user to read the contents of the directory. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to limit permissions to the necessary users or groups, rather than granting blanket access. If the intention is to make the directory readable by the owner or group, use `chmod -R u+rx DIRNAME` instead (assuming r and x are already set for owner or group), or `chmod -R ug+rx DIRNAME` to grant read and execute permissions. The exact fix should consider the specific security requirements and users.

ORIGINAL CODE:
chmod -R ugo+r DIRNAME
