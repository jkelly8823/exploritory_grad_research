VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code has a vulnerability due to an inconsistent use of variables.

EXPLANATION:
The code is trying to implement a select operation based on the value of `ariane_boot_sel_i`. However, it is assigning `rom_rdata_linux` in both the true and false cases. This means that `rom_rdata_patch` is not used in the select operation, and the choice between `rom_rdata_patch` and `rom_rdata_linux` is not actually dependent on `ariane_boot_sel_i`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the correct variable for the false case, `rom_rdata_patch`. The corrected statement would be:
```verilog
assign rom_rdata = (ariane_boot_sel_i) ? rom_rdata_linux : rom_rdata_patch;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
...
			
			bootrom i_bootrom_patch (
				
				.clk_i                   ,
				.req_i      ( rom_req   ),
				.addr_i     ( rom_addr  ),
				.rdata_o    ( rom_rdata_patch )
				
			);
			bootrom_linux i_bootrom_linux (
				
				.clk_i                   ,
				.req_i      ( rom_req   ),
				.addr_i     ( rom_addr  ),
				.rdata_o    ( rom_rdata_linux )
				
			);
			
			assign rom_rdata = (ariane_boot_sel_i) ? rom_rdata_linux : rom_rdata_linux;
