VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of the mcrypt_encrypt function and usage of weak encryption algorithms.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the mcrypt_encrypt function, which is deprecated and should not be used for new code. Furthermore, it uses the MCRYPT_DES algorithm, which is weak and considered insecure. The MCRYPT_MODE_ECB mode is also insecure as it does not provide any authentication or integrity of the encrypted data. Additionally, the use of a fixed IV and hard-coded encryption key makes the code vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update to a modern encryption library such as OpenSSL or hash library.
2. Use a secure encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
3. Use a secure mode of operation such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) or OCB (Offset Codebook Mode).
4. Use a secure way to generate encryption keys.
5. Use a secure way to generate initialization vectors (IVs).
Example:

```php
function encryptPassword($password) {
    $key = hash('sha256', 'This is a password encryption key', true);
    $encryptedPassword = openssl_encrypt($password, 'aes-256-cbc', $key, 0, 'This is an initialization vector');
    return $encryptedPassword;
}
```
Note: This is a simplified example and should be adapted to the specific use case.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function encryptPassword($password){
    $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_DES, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
    $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
    $key = "This is a password encryption key";
    $encryptedPassword = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $password, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv);
    return $encryptedPassword;
}
```
