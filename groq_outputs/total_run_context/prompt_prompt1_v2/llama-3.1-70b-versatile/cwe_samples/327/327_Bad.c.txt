VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (Single-line statement)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure encryption function
EXPLANATION:
The use of `EVP_des_ecb()` function indicates an insecure encryption method. This function uses the DES encryption algorithm in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, which is considered insecure due to its vulnerability to block chaining attacks and short block size. ECB mode does not provide any protection against chosen-plaintext attacks and can be easily broken.

Furthermore, DES has a relatively small key size (56 bits) and block size (64 bits), which makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a secure encryption algorithm such as AES, and choose a secure mode like GCM or CBC. The OpenSSL EVP API provides functions like `EVP_aes_256_gcm()` or `EVP_aes_256_cbc()` that use secure encryption algorithms and modes.

Additionally, ensure to properly initialize and finalize the EVP context using `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new()` and `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free()` to prevent potential memory leaks and other issues.
