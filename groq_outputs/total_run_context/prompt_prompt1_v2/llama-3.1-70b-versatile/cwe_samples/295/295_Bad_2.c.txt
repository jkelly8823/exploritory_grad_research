VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Lines containing the if statement and the SSL_get_verify_result function call
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability in this code is related to the insecure handling of TLS certificate validation using OpenSSL.

EXPLANATION:
The code does not properly handle all possible error cases when verifying a TLS certificate. Specifically, it only checks for two possible validation outcomes: X509_V_OK and X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED. This is incomplete as there are many other possible error cases (e.g. X509_V_ERR_CERT_REJECTED, X509_V_ERR_CERT_UNTRUSTED, etc.) that are not checked. This means that certificates that should be rejected (e.g. ones that are not issued by a trusted certificate authority) may still be accepted.

Furthermore, the `if` statement using a single equals sign `cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` is a potential vulnerability as it is potentially assigning a value to `cert` and then testing its truthiness, rather than checking for equality.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:
- Change the single equals sign `=` in the `if` statement to a double equals sign `==` to compare the value of `cert` instead of assigning it.
- Properly handle all possible error cases when verifying a TLS certificate by checking the value of `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` against all possible error codes and reject certificates that do not pass validation.

ORIGINAL CODE:

if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))
    
        //do stuff
        
    }
}
