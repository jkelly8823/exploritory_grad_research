VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet reveals hardcoded sensitive data, specifically a username and password for LDAP authentication.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains explicit mention of a username ("secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.username") and password ("secretPassword"). Hardcoding sensitive data directly in the code poses a significant security risk. In the event of the code being exposed or accessed by an unauthorized individual, the sensitive credentials could be compromised. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following steps:
1. Remove hardcoded credentials: Instead of directly storing sensitive data in the code, use environment variables, configuration files, or a secure secrets management mechanism.
2. Use a secure storage mechanism: Store sensitive data in a solution designed for secure data storage, such as Key Vault, Hashicorp's Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets.
3. Utilize secure credential injection: Leverage the deployment environment to securely inject required credentials.
