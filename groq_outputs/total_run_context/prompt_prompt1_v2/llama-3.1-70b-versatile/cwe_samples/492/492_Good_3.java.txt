VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the form of a lack of validation and a potential Java Reflection vulnerability in the form of unsanitized variable conversion.

EXPLANATION:
The section of code has two identified potential issues. 

First, despite performing a check for MalformedURLException exceptions after creating a URL from a potentially unsanitized input (the enterUrlTextField variable), the variable value does not undergo any real validation (except for seeing that it does not cause a MalFormatUrl exception upon being passed to the constructor for a URL), which is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Secondly, there is a likelihood that getActionCommand, or otherwise some values obtained from  the enterUrlTextField variable which came from user input, might not only include normal values for variables, but also a malicious user provided representation of values which could result in  unsanitized input similar to reflective-XSS; considering an eventual exploit for crafted variables submitted. Thus allowing to remote execute code on a java server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
    1.  Implement proper input validation for user input.  This can be achieved through 
    verifying that the entered URL conforms to a specified format and then verifying that the entered URL 
    does not attempt to submit an XSS attack.
    2.  Use HTML entities encoding when displaying the content of untrusted sources.
   It may be beneficial to reference https://www.owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
    Specifically review A07:2021 Identification and Authentication Failures or A03:2021-Injection and remember to 
    validate the “validity of” untrusted inputs in software layers.

                           // private member variables for applet components
                           private Label enterUrlLabel;private TextField enterUrlTextField;private Button submitButton;
                           
                           // init method that adds components to applet
                           public void init() {setLayout(new FlowLayout());enterUrlLabel = new Label("Enter URL: ");enterUrlTextField = new TextField("", 20);submitButton = new Button("Submit");add(enterUrlLabel);add(enterUrlTextField);add(submitButton);submitButton.addActionListener(this);}
                           
                           // implementation of actionPerformed method of ActionListener interface
                           public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
                              if (evt.getSource() == submitButton) {String urlString = enterUrlTextField.getText();URL url = null;try {url = new URL(urlString);} catch (MalformedURLException e) {System.err.println("Malformed URL: " + urlString);}if (url != null) {getAppletContext().showDocument(url);}}
                           }
                     }
