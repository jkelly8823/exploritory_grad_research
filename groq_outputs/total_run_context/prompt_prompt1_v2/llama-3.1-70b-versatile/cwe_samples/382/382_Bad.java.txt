VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code uses System.exit(1) in a catch block to terminate the application when an exception is caught. This can lead to unexpected application termination and potentially make the system more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

EXPLANATION: 
The use of System.exit(1) in a catch block is generally discouraged in Java-based web applications. It can cause the entire application to terminate, which can lead to unexpected behavior, file descriptor leaks, and potential security vulnerabilities. In this specific case, the exception handling is performed in a doPost method, which is likely a part of a web application's request handling mechanism. If a malicious user sends a request that triggers the ApplicationSpecificException, the entire application can be terminated, making the system more vulnerable to DoS attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Instead of calling System.exit(1), consider alternatives to handle the exception, such as:

*  Logging the exception and continuing with the application's normal operation.
*  Returning an error response to the client, indicating the exception.
*  Using a custom error handling mechanism to handle the exception.

It is also recommended to log the exception in a more robust manner, such as using a logging framework that supports structured logging, like Log4j or Logback.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
try {...} 
catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
System.exit(1);
}
```
