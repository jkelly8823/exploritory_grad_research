VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of weak random number generator for generating sensitive data (accountID).

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `Random` class, which is not suitable for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. Additionally, the seed value `System.currentTimeMillis()` can be easily predicted, further reducing the randomness of the generated number. This can lead to weaknesses in security, as an attacker might be able to predict or brute-force the generated ID.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To generate a cryptographically secure random number, use the `SecureRandom` class instead of `Random`. Also, consider using a more secure method for generating unique IDs, such as a UUID or a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());int accountID = random.nextInt();
