VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided demonstrates a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `scanf` function reads input from the user and stores it in the `last_name` array without any bounds checking. Since the `last_name` array is 20 characters long, if the user enters more than 19 characters (1 character is reserved for the null terminator), it will overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or other unexpected behavior.

Furthermore, using `scanf` with a `%s` format specifier is particularly vulnerable to buffer overflow, as it will continue reading input until it encounters a whitespace character or the input buffer is exhausted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following fixes:
1. Use `fgets` instead of `scanf`, which allows for safer input handling and bounds checking:

```c
char last_name[20];
printf ("Enter your last name: ");
if (fgets(last_name, sizeof(last_name), stdin) == NULL) {
    // Handle input error
}
last_name[strcspn(last_name, "\n")] = 0; // Remove trailing newline character
```

2. Alternatively, use `scanf` with a width specifier to prevent buffer overflow:

```c
char last_name[20];
printf ("Enter your last name: ");
scanf("%19s", last_name); // Leave 1 character for the null terminator
```

In both cases, validate the input data to ensure it meets the required format and length.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char last_name[20];printf ("Enter your last name: ");scanf ("%s", last_name);
```
