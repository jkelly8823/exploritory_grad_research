VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability due to Unbounded String Copy

EXPLANATION:
This function `manipulate_string` takes a `char *` as input and copies it to a fixed-size buffer `buf` of size 24 using `strcpy`. The problem is that `strcpy` does not perform any bounds checking on the source string, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer by providing a string longer than 23 characters. When the buffer overflows, it can potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer alternative to `strcpy`, such as `strncpy` or `snprintf`, which allow you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy. Additionally, it is essential to check the length of the input string before copying it to the buffer. Here's a recommended fix:

```c
void manipulate_string(char * string){
    char buf[24];
    strncpy(buf, string, sizeof(buf) - 1);
    buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0'; // null-terminate the string
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```
Alternatively, consider using a dynamic buffer allocation approach, where the buffer size is determined based on the length of the input string.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void manipulate_string(char * string){char buf[24];strcpy(buf, string);...}
```
