VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Resource Leak due to incorrect exception handling in the displayProductSummary method.

EXPLANATION:
In the displayProductSummary method, a new variable 'productSummary' is declared and initialized with a call to getProductSummary(index) inside a try block. However, a new 'productSummary' variable is also declared outside the try block. As a result, if an exception is not thrown, this outer 'productSummary' variable will be returned, which has no connection to the inner 'productSummary' variable. Furthermore, in the catch block, the exception is caught but not handled. In a case where a resource is used in the try block (like a database connection or a file), it will not be properly closed, resulting in a resource leak. Although in this specific case no resource is used, the incorrect exception handling can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the variable inside the try block is unnecessary and can be removed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) Remove the inner 'productSummary' variable declaration and use the outer one.
2) Handle the caught exception properly or rethrow it.
3) Consider logging the error for debugging purposes.
4) If resources are used in the try block (like files, database connections, etc.), ensure they are properly closed.

ORIGINAL CODE:


// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
    return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = "";
    if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX_PRODUCTS)) {productSummary = products[index];}else {System.err.println("index is out of bounds");throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();}
    return productSummary;
}
