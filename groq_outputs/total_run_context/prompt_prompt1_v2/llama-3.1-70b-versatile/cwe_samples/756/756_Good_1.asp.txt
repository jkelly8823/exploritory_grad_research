VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Information Disclosure via Error Messages
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet sets the `customErrors` mode to "On", but it does not prevent the disclosure of sensitive information in the error messages. Even with a custom error page, it's still possible for developers to accidentally reveal sensitive information, such as stack traces or error details. An attacker could potentially use this information to learn about the underlying system and identify potential vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

* Set `customErrors` mode to "On" only in production environments to prevent detailed error messages from being displayed to end-users.
* Implement a secure error handling mechanism that logs sensitive information but prevents it from being displayed to users.
* Use the `redirectMode` attribute to specify how errors are redirected to the custom error page. For example, set `redirectMode="ResponseRewrite"` to prevent the original error URL from being displayed in the browser's address bar.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm" />
```
