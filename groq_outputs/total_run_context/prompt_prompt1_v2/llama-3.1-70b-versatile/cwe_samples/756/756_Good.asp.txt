VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Error Handling Configuration

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet configures custom error handling for an application with the mode set to "RemoteOnly". This setting causes detailed error messages to be suppressed for remote requests, but still allows local requests to receive detailed error messages. However, this may inadvertently expose sensitive information about the application or its environment to local users.

In certain environments, local access may be granted to unauthorized users (e.g., developers or IT personnel). This setting allows them to access detailed error messages containing potential security-sensitive information.

Additionally, depending on the environment, it's possible for an attacker to gain local access through various attack vectors. Here, they can exploit this configuration to gain insight into the internal workings or vulnerabilities of the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider setting custom error handling mode to "On" or "Off" (in place of "RemoteOnly"), and utilize a more secure error logging mechanism to monitor and handle application errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" />
               
Note: "Off" is recommended during development, while "On" is recommended during production. Note that this change may affect debugging, so ensure an alternative means of tracking errors is implemented.
