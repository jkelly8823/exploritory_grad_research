VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insufficient Exception Handling and Potential for Information Disclosure

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet catches a custom exception (`ApplicationSpecificException`) but only logs it using the `error` method of a logger. The problem is that the exception is logged using the `toString` method, which can potentially disclose sensitive information about the application. Furthermore, there is no indication that the exception is properly handled or that the application's state is restored after the exception is caught.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend catching and handling exceptions more securely:

1. Instead of using the `toString` method, consider logging only the exception message (if necessary), and using a logging framework that allows logging exceptions without disclosing sensitive information.

Example:
```java
} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
    logger.error(ase.getMessage());
}
```

2. If possible, handle the exception in a way that restores the application's state, e.g., by providing a fallback response or retrying the operation.

3. If the exception is critical, consider throwing it further up the call stack or re-throwing it as a new exception with a generic error message, rather than logging and ignoring it.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {
        ...
    } catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
        logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
    }
}
```
