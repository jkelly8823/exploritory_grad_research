VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Error Handling - Sensitive Information Disclosure

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a segment of a web.config file, configuring custom error handling in an ASP.NET application. The line `<customErrors mode="Off" />` is specifying that error handling is disabled, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about the application and its environment. When error handling is set to "Off", detailed error messages are displayed, including the source code, stack traces, and other sensitive details that an attacker can use to gain knowledge about the application's vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to set the `mode` attribute of the `<customErrors>` element to "On" or "RemoteOnly". This will ensure that detailed error messages are not displayed to the user, reducing the amount of sensitive information that is exposed. 

Additionally, consider defining a custom error page that displays a generic error message, providing users with information on what happened without revealing sensitive details.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <customErrors mode="Off" />
