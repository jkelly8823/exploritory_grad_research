VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Directory Traversal Vulnerability via User Input

EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, which can allow an attacker to access sensitive files on the server. This vulnerability occurs when user input ($Username) is not properly sanitized before being concatenated with a file path. 

Even though the code attempts to prevent traversal by removing '../' from the beginning of the username, it does not prevent traversal when '../' is not at the beginning. This means that attackers can still traverse the directory structure by providing a username like 'foo../bar' which will bypass the sanitization check.

Additionally, this vulnerability can also be exploited by using relative paths like 'foo/../../../../secretFile' if the web application lacks input validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, it is necessary to properly sanitize the input data ($Username) and ensure that it only includes authorized characters. Here are some recommendations to address this issue:

*   Validate the input to restrict its format to a specific pattern, such as alphanumeric characters and special characters, using a regular expression.
*   Use the 'uri-escape' function to encode any special characters, if present, and prevent them from being interpreted by the ReadAndSendFile function.
*   Ensure the input is within a certain length limit to prevent any path manipulation attacks.
*   Avoid directly concatenating user input with file paths to prevent directory traversal. Instead, consider using a templating mechanism or whitelist-approved paths.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {
    $Username = substr($Username, 3);
}
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
