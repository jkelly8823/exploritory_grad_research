VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code does not follow best practices for exception handling. Specifically, the invocation of `logger.error` from within multiple catch blocks presents a potential logging vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The repetition of identical error logging calls in each catch block may lead to incorrect error messages or a lack of context in case of an exception. Also, it hides the original cause of the error, as `InvocationTargetException` is typically a wrapper exception that can be caused by various underlying exceptions. These details can be crucial for identifying and debugging the issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a single try-catch block and rethrow the original exception, or extract the error logging to a separate method. This will remove code duplication and provide accurate error messages. For instance, you can handle multiple exceptions in a single catch block by using the `MultiCatchException`, add specific exception types in the method declaration and parse these exceptions properly in the catch block.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
try {doExchange();}catch (IOException e) {logger.error("doExchange failed", e);}catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
    logger.error("doExchange failed", e);
}catch (SQLException e) {
    logger.error("doExchange failed", e);
}
```

Example of improved code:
```
try {
    doExchange();
} catch (IOException | InvocationTargetException | SQLException e) {
    logger.error("doExchange failed", e);
}
```
