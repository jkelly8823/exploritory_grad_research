VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability and potential Privilege Escalation.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code seems to be part of a method that prints debug information for a user. However, the method `isAuthenticated(requestingUser)` is not shown, so we're assuming it correctly checks the authentication status of the user. The method further checks the role of the user and prints either an unauthorized message for guests or the current debug state for other users.

The issue lies in the fact that this method does not properly validate if the `requestingUser` object has been properly initialized or if its `role` field has been tampered with. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `role` field of the `requestingUser` object to elevate their privileges. 

Additionally, the provided code does not validate if the `currentDebugState()` method returns sensitive information that should not be exposed to non-admin users. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider implementing the following:

*   Validate the `requestingUser` object and its `role` field to ensure they have not been tampered with.
*   Implement proper access control to prevent users from accessing sensitive information they are not authorized to access.
*   Use a secure way to store and retrieve user roles to prevent tampering.
*   Restrict the `currentDebugState()` method to only return non-sensitive information for non-admin users.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public enum Roles {ADMIN,USER,GUEST}
public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
    if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
        switch(requestingUser.role){
            case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
            default:System.out.println(currentDebugState());break;
        }
    }else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
}
```
