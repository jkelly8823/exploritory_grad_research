VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet defines a private method `readObject` which is used for object deserialization. Instead of actually deserializing the object, it immediately throws an `IOException` with a message indicating that deserialization is not supported. This approach is actually a best practice for security as it prevents an attacker from potentially exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities. 

By explicitly throwing an exception in the `readObject` method, this code is implicitly disallowing any malicious deserialization attacks. Therefore, no vulnerabilities were detected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary. This code appears to be properly secured.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws java.io.IOException {throw new java.io.IOException("Cannot be deserialized"); }
```
