VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive information (plain text password)

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a hardcoded password ("pwd=password;") in plain text. Hardcoding sensitive information such as database credentials can pose significant security risks if the code is exposed or accessed by unauthorized individuals. An attacker could use the obtained credentials to gain access to the database and manipulate or leak sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Environment variables or configuration files**: Store sensitive information like database credentials in environment variables or secure configuration files instead of hardcoding them directly in the code.
2. **Secure configuration management**: Implement a secure configuration management process to store and manage sensitive information, such as using vaults or secure key management systems.
3. **Encryption**: Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest and when transmitted.
