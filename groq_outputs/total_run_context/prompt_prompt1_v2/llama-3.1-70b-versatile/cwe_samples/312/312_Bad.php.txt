VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet contains a vulnerability related to insecure password storage and insecure transmission of sensitive data through cookies.

EXPLANATION:
The code stores the user's password in plain text and transmits it in a cookie, making it easily accessible to an attacker. Storing passwords in plain text is a serious security risk, as it allows an attacker to obtain the password if they gain access to the stored data. Additionally, transmitting sensitive data such as passwords through cookies is insecure because cookies can be easily intercepted by an attacker, either through a man-in-the-middle attack or by accessing the cookie on the client-side.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following recommendations should be implemented:

* Hash and salt the password before storing it. Use a secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
* Store the hashed password on the server-side, not in a cookie.
* Use a secure method to store and retrieve the user's data, such as token-based authentication. A secure token should be generated and stored on the server-side, and a corresponding cookie should be set on the client-side with a reference to this token.
* Use HTTPS to encrypt the transmission of data between the client and server.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function persistLogin($username, $password){$data = array("username" => $username, "password"=> $password);setcookie ("userdata", $data);}
```
