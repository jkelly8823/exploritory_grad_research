VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Cookie Generation
EXPLANATION:
The presented code snippet creates a new Cookie object and adds it to an HTTP response. However, it does not specify any security attributes, making it vulnerable to insecurity. By default, the cookie is sent in plain text, allowing an attacker to intercept and manipulate it. Additionally, without specifying the secure flag, the cookie will be sent over HTTP, increasing the risk of eavesdropping and tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the cookie should be created with the secure and HttpOnly flags set to true. This can be achieved by adding the following attributes to the Cookie object: `Cookie cookie = new Cookie("userAccountID", acctID); cookie.setSecure(true); cookie.setHttpOnly(true); response.addCookie(cookie);` This will ensure that the cookie is sent over a secure connection (HTTPS) and restricts access to it from JavaScript.
ORIGINAL CODE:
response.addCookie( new Cookie("userAccountID", acctID);
