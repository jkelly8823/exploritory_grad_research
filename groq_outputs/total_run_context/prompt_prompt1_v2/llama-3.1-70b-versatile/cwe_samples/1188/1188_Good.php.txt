VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated and unsanitized input from the user is directly used in the code, without proper validation or escaping, potentially leading to SQL injection or other security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code directly assigns user inputs from the `$_POST` superglobal array to variables `$user` and `$pass`, without any validation, sanitization or escaping. This can lead to SQL injection attacks, as an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through these input fields. Additionally, the use of the `login_user` function is unclear, but it is assumed that it queries a database for authentication. The lack of input validation and sanitization can potentially allow attackers to inject malicious SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Input validation and sanitization should be performed on all user inputs to prevent malicious data from reaching the database. The following recommendations are made:

* Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats (e.g., username and password length, characters, etc.)
* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
* Sanitize user input to remove any special characters or escape sequences
* Consider using a secure authentication library that handles user authentication securely

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
```
