VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Authorization Bypass through Insufficient Authentication, Potential Use of Unvalidated User Input

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet shows the automatic setting of user credentials from a POST request. The 'login_user' function is then called with these credentials. However, this snippet does not validate if the user input has been sanitized or validated before being used in the 'login_user' function call and the 'generatePage()' function call.

In addition, the 'login_user' function call does not appear to handle errors and exceptions properly. This can result in an authorization bypass if a malicious actor is able to manipulate or inject user credentials.

The broader concern here lies with the potential for an attacker to send a POST request with known credentials or manipulated credentials. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation: Ensure that the user input from the POST request ($user, $pass) has been properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential SQL injection or other kinds of attacks.
2. Error and Exception Handling: Ensure that the 'login_user' function properly handles errors and exceptions. Implement proper error checking to ensure that exceptions are properly caught and handled to prevent potential authorization bypass or denial-of-service attacks.
3. Implement additional security measures: Implement additional security measures, such as account lockout policies, IP blocking, and two-factor authentication, to prevent brute-force attacks and enhance the overall security posture of the application.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                    // $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
                    if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
                    ...
                    
                  if ($authorized) {generatePage();}
