VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Exposure of sensitive key data through debug mode.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet uses a debug mode flag to select between two paths for assigning a key to the variable `core_key0`. When `debug_mode_i` is asserted, the key is set to `'b0`, exposing the possibility of sensitive key data being overwritten or logged. In a secure system, cryptographic keys should be handled with extreme care and should never be left unattended in systems or code.

However, when `debug_mode_i` is not asserted, `core_key0` is assigned from a register that likely holds a key, but when debug mode is enabled, it gets overwritten. 

The real issue starts when using the value from key register (key_reg1) to assign core_key1 directly. Using direct assignment of registers to sensitive information may potentially expose this sensitive data. In secure environments, keys should be kept separate and protected from users as well as applications.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always handle sensitive data (like cryptographic keys) with care and prevent sensitive information from being exposed or potentially logged during the usage of a debug mode.
- Ensure to not use debug modes in deployed or production-environment systems whenever possible.
- Do not use direct assignments to sensitive variables if there's even a remote possibility that variable can be exposed to users.

- Instead of hardcoding sensitive information, consider implementing functions to create/get these values - it generally makes key management safe.

- Code should never output sensitive values directly. If such value is needed, consider obfuscating before releasing.
