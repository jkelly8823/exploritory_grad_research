VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential insecure logging vulnerability, as it directly logs sensitive information (CCN: credit card number) to the logger.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a logger statement that logs sensitive information, specifically a credit card number (CCN). This can be a serious security concern as logging sensitive data can expose it to unauthorized parties, including system administrators, or may be written to log files that are not properly secured. Moreover, the credit card number may also be visible in the console or logs, which can potentially be accessed by unauthorized individuals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid logging sensitive information such as credit card numbers directly. Instead, consider using secure logging practices:
- Log a generic error message instead of including sensitive data.
- Use a token or hash value for sensitive data instead of logging the actual data.
- Implement a mechanism to redact or remove sensitive information from logs.
- Make sure that log files and consoles are properly secured and access-controlled.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
logger.info("Username: " + usernme + ", CCN: " + ccn);
```
