VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. This occurs because the `query` string variable directly concatenates user input (`username` and `accountNumber`) into the SQL query. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the input values.

For example, if an attacker provides `username` as `Robert'); DROP TABLE accounts; --`, the resulting SQL query would attempt to drop the entire `accounts` table. This demonstrates the potential for severe harm that can result from such vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's essential to use prepared statements with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into SQL queries directly.

The recommended fixes are:

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE owner = ? AND accountID = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, username);
pstmt.setString(2, accountNumber);
ResultSet queryResult = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

In this revised version, the `username` and `accountNumber` values are passed as parameters to the prepared statement, preventing any injected SQL code from being executed.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public BankAccount getUserBankAccount(String username, String accountNumber) {
    BankAccount userAccount = null;
    String query = null;
    try {
        if (isAuthorizedUser(username)) {
            query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE owner = "+ username + " AND accountID = " + accountNumber;
            DatabaseManager dbManager = new DatabaseManager();
            Connection conn = dbManager.getConnection();
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet queryResult = stmt.executeQuery(query);
            userAccount = (BankAccount)queryResult.getObject(accountNumber);
        }
    } catch (SQLException ex) {
        String logMessage = "Unable to retrieve account information from database,\nquery: " + query;
        Logger.getLogger(BankManager.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, logMessage, ex);
    }
    return userAccount;
}
```
