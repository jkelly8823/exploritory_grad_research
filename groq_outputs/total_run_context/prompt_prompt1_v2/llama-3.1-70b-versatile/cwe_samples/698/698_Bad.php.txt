VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and potentially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the execution of HTTP redirects and printing server status.

EXPLANATION:
The `http_redirect` function is being called with the `$errorPageURL` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. However, this is a potential vulnerability if this variable is not properly sanitized or validated, as it may allow an attacker to execute SSRF attacks. 

Furthermore, the `echo $status` statement is directly printing the server status to the user. If the server status is not properly sanitized, an attacker may inject malicious data into the server status, potentially leading to XSS attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `$requestingIP` variable before using it in the `in_array` function to prevent potentially unexpected behavior.
2. Ensure the `$errorPageURL` variable is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to the `http_redirect` function to prevent SSRF attacks.
3. Implement origin-based restrictions to prevent SSRF attacks. Only allow redirects to trusted domains or URLs.
4. Sanitize and validate the server status data before echoing it to the user to prevent XSS attacks. Use a library or function to clean the data and prevent injection of malicious code.
5. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as logging and alerting on security-related HTTP redirects, to detect potential SSRF attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){
    echo "You are not authorized to view this page";
        http_redirect($errorPageURL);
}
$status = getServerStatus();
echo $status;
