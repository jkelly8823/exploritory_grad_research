VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function allows users with higher-than-basic roles to reset passwords without any authentication checks for the targeted user.
EXPLANATION:
This function presents a vulnerability in that a requesting user, who is an 'OPERATOR' or 'ADMIN', can reset any other user's password without being verified as the owner of the targeted account. This is particularly vulnerable for administrators who will bypass any "You must be logged in to perform this command" check, but still don't pass separate checks that should require stronger, non admin-based, verification.

Furthermore, the method only checks if the requestingUser is authenticated. However, it does not validate if the requestingUser has the necessary permissions or rights to reset the password of the targeted user, potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix is to introduce additional checks to validate that the requestingUser has the necessary permissions or rights to reset the targeted user's password. 

For example, one approach is to introduce a separate method that verifies if the requestingUser is authorized to reset the password of the targeted user, perhaps by requiring a re-authentication step specific to the target user.

Additionally, consider input validation and proper error handling for improved security. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  public enum Roles {ADMIN,OPERATOR,USER,GUEST}
                     public void resetPassword(User requestingUser, User user, String password ){
                        if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
                              switch(requestingUser.role){
                                    case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       case USER:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       default:setPassword(user,password);break;}
                                 }
                           
                           else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
                     }
