VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Vulnerability in string manipulation using strcpy, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses strcpy to copy data from srcBuf to destBuf starting at the index idx. However, strcpy does not perform any bounds checking, so if the data in srcBuf exceeds the remaining buffer space in destBuf, it can cause a buffer overflow. This is further complicated by the fact that the destination buffer is being modified in-place after finding a specific substring.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use strncpy instead of strcpy to limit the number of bytes copied. This would ensure that the entire buffer is not overwritten, even if the data in srcBuf exceeds the remaining buffer space. However, it is also crucial to handle the null-termination character in this case, as strncpy does not guarantee that the destination buffer is null-terminated. Alternatively, consider using a safer string manipulation function like memmove or snprintf.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```

Note: It's essential to ensure that destBuf is large enough to accommodate the data being written, and to handle potential edge cases where the "Replace Me" substring is not found or when the replacement string is longer than the original string.
