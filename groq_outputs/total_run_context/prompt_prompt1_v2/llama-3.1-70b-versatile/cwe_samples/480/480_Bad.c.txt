VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses a single equals sign (=) for comparison instead of a double equals sign (==) in the if statement, which can cause an accidental assignment and lead to unexpected behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises in the line `if (value=100)`. In C programming, a single equals sign is used for assignment, not comparison. Therefore, instead of comparing the value of `value` to 100, the code is assigning 100 to `value`. The if statement then evaluates the assigned value (which is non-zero and thus true in C), causing it to always execute the code inside the if block.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a double equals sign (==) for comparison instead of a single equals sign (=) in the if statement. 

```c
int isValid(int value) {if (value==100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
int isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}
