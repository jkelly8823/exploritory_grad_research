VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overwrite Vulnerability due to Unchecked String Copy.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overwrite attack. The `strcpy` function is used to copy the contents of `srcBuf` into `destBuf` without checking the bounds of `destBuf`. The index `idx` is used to position the copy operation within `destBuf`, but it does not account for the length of `srcBuf`. If `srcBuf` is longer than the remaining space in `destBuf`, the copy operation will overflow the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack or data corruption.

Furthermore, the use of `strstr` to find the position of the string "Replace Me" in `destBuf` suggests that `destBuf` might be a dynamically allocated buffer, and `srcBuf` might contain user-controlled data. This combination increases the likelihood of a buffer overflow attack, as an attacker could potentially manipulate `srcBuf` to be longer than the remaining space in `destBuf`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer string copy function like `strncpy` or `memcpy`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of bytes to copy. Additionally, you should always check the bounds of the destination buffer to prevent buffer overflows.

Here is an updated version of the code snippet with the recommended fixes:
```
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    int srcLen = strlen(srcBuf);
    int remainingSpace = sizeof(destBuf) - idx;
    int copyLen = MIN(srcLen, remainingSpace);
    strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, copyLen);
    ...
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```
