VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-Bounds Array Access

EXPLANATION:
The issue with the provided code snippet is that it declares an array `id_sequence` of size 3 but attempts to populate it up to index 3 (`id_sequence[3] = 456`). In C, arrays are 0-indexed, which means the maximum valid index for this array is 2. The attempt to access `id_sequence[3]` is beyond the bounds of the array.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this issue, the array should be resized to accommodate the additional element, or the value assignment should be removed to prevent buffer overflow. A secure approach is to add a check before assignment to prevent potential overflows.

```
int id_sequence[4];  // resize array to accommodate additional elements
/* Populate the id array. */
id_sequence[0] = 123;
id_sequence[1] = 234;
id_sequence[2] = 345;
id_sequence[3] = 456;
```

Alternatively, using a dynamically-sized data structure like vectors or dynamic arrays (available in higher-level languages like C++ or scripting languages) can help prevent such issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int id_sequence[3];
/* Populate the id array. */
id_sequence[0] = 123;id_sequence[1] = 234;id_sequence[2] = 345;id_sequence[3] = 456;
```
