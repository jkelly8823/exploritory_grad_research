VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: returnChunkSize line and main line
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from an unchecked buffer overflow condition. The returnChunkSize function returns the size of the usable memory, but it is decremented by 1 before being passed to memcpy. If the memory block allocated by returnChunkSize has a size of 0 or 1, this subtraction would result in a negative value. The memcpy function treats this value as an unsigned int, causing it to interpret it as a very large value. This would cause memcpy to attempt to copy a large amount of data to destBuf, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, ensure that the return value of returnChunkSize is checked before subtracting 1. A conditional statement can be used to prevent the negative value from being passed to memcpy. The size should also be checked to ensure it is not too large for the destination buffer.

Here's an example of the fix:
```c
int chunkSize = returnChunkSize(destBuf);
if (chunkSize > 0) {
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (chunkSize - 1));
} else {
    // Handle the case where chunkSize is 0 or returns an error
}
```
Additionally, consider using a safer alternative to memcpy, such as strncpy or strlcpy for strings, or manually using a loop with bounds checking.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int returnChunkSize(void *) {
    ...
}

int main() {
    ...
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf) - 1));
    ...
}
```
