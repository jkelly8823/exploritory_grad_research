VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack, and also to a File Inclusion Vulnerability, which can be used to write a malicious file to the server's file system.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the basename() function on the filename provided by the user, which is intended to prevent path traversal attacks. However, this alone is not sufficient to prevent such attacks, because it relies on the filename provided by the user, which can be manipulated. If an attacker uploads a file with a filename that contains directory traversal characters (e.g., ../), they can potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the server.

Additionally, the code does not validate the file type of the uploaded file, which can lead to a File Inclusion Vulnerability if the attacker is able to upload a malicious PHP file.

The use of user input in the filename without proper validation and sanitization also increases the risk of a Path Traversal attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always validate and sanitize user input, in this case, the filename. Use a whitelist approach to only allow files with specific extensions.
2. Use a secure filename generation mechanism that does not rely on user input, such as using a unique identifier generated by the server.
3. Use the pathinfo() function to get the filename without the directory path, and then use the resulting filename to construct the target path.
4. Use the mime_content_type() function to validate the file type of the uploaded file, and only allow files with specific mime types.

ORIGINAL CODE:


// Define the target location where the picture being
// uploaded is going to be saved.
$target = "pictures/" . basename($_FILES['uploadedfile']['name']);

// Move the uploaded file to the new location.
if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'], $target)){echo "The picture has been successfully uploaded.";}else{echo "There was an error uploading the picture, please try again.";}
