VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability through file upload.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of an HTML form for file uploads. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the uploaded file in the provided code. This could potentially allow an attacker to upload malicious files, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 

Moreover, the form action is set to a servlet ('FileUploadServlet'), which might not be secure if it doesn't handle file uploads properly. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the servlet to steal sensitive data or execute malicious code.

Additionally, the 'enctype' attribute in the form tag is set to 'multipart/form-data', which allows the upload of binary data. If not properly validated, this could lead to security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the type of uploaded file and ensure it conforms to expected formats.
2. Use a secure library for file uploads that provides built-in validation and sanitization.
3. Ensure that the 'FileUploadServlet' properly handles file uploads, including validation and sanitization.
4. Implement proper error handling in case of malicious or invalid file uploads.
5. Use HTML escaping on any file names or paths that are echoed back to the user to prevent XSS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<form action="FileUploadServlet" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
   Choose a file to upload:</input type="file" name="filename"/><br/><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"/>
   </form>
```
