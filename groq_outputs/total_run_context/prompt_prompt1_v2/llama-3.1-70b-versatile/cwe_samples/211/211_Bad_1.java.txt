VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. The `setInputFile` method does not perform any validation on the provided file path, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the `inputFilePath` variable by traversing up or down the directory tree using '../' or './' sequences.

The vulnerability occurs on line 9, where the `setInputFile` method does not validate the input. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory by providing a specially crafted file path.

Although the code comments suggest that "validation / encoding is used and privileges / permissions are preserved", the actual validation logic is missing, making it vulnerable to attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the input file path in the `setInputFile` method to ensure it does not contain any malicious paths. You can use a library such as `java.nio.file.Paths` to normalize the path and prevent directory traversal.

Additionally, consider using a `FileUtils` class or a similar utility to handle file operations securely.

Example fix:

```java
public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {
    try {
        // Normalize the file path to prevent directory traversal
        Path inputFilePath = Paths.get(inputFile);
        if (!inputFilePath.normalize().startsWith(DEFAULT_FILE_PATH)) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Invalid file path");
        }
        this.inputFilePath = inputFilePath.toString();
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public class InputFileRead {
    
    private File readFile = null;
    private FileReader reader = null;
    private String inputFilePath = null;
    private final String DEFAULT_FILE_PATH = "c:\\somedirectory\\";

    public InputFileRead() {
        inputFilePath = DEFAULT_FILE_PATH;
    }

    public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {
        // Assume appropriate validation / encoding is used and privileges / permissions are preserved
    }

    public void readInputFile() {
        try {
            reader = new FileReader(readFile);...
        } catch (RuntimeException rex) {
            System.err.println("Error: Cannot open input file in the directory " + inputFilePath);
            System.err.println("Input file has not been set, call setInputFile method before calling readInputFile");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
            //...
        }
    }
}
```
