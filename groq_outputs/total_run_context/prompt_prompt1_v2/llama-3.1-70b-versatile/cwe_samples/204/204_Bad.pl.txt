VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and potential SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses user input directly from `param('username')` and `param('password')`. The variables `$username` and `$password` are passed directly to functions `IsValidUsername($username)` and `IsValidPassword($username, $password)`, respectively. 

Without knowing the implementation of `IsValidUsername($username)` and `IsValidPassword($username, $password)`, it's assumed that these functions might execute database queries or interact with sensitive data using the provided user input.

In its current state, there is no sanitization, validation, or parameterization to prevent a potential attacker from exploiting this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL commands or tampering with sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize and validate both `$username` and `$password` variables to prevent user input from causing database queries or other sensitive operations to execute malicious commands. 
2. Consider using prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Avoid passing sensitive data, like passwords, as function arguments. Instead, use more secure methods for password comparison.
4. Consider implementing more robust user authentication mechanisms to prevent insecure direct object references.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
my $username=param('username');
my $password=param('password');

if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
{
if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
{
print "Login Successful";
}
else
{
print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
}
}
else
{
print "Login Failed - unknown username";
}
