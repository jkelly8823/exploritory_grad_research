VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Sensitive information exposure: The code directly prints the database connection string, which contains sensitive information about the database server, including the server name.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet logs the database connection string to the console. This connection string contains sensitive information about the database server, such as the server name. Exposing this information publicly poses a significant security risk, as an attacker could use this information to access the database without authorization.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `Console.WriteLine(cs);` statement to prevent logging the connection string.
2. Store the connection string securely, such as in environment variables or encrypted configuration files.
3. Consider using a secure tokenized approach to handle database credentials instead of hardcoding or logging them.
4. Implement a logging mechanism that can redact or mask sensitive information before logging.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                 string cs="database=northwind; server=mySQLServer...";SqlConnection conn=new SqlConnection(cs);...Console.Writeline(cs);
