VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a command injection attack. Although the username is guaranteed to be alphanumeric, the use of the 'grep' command is not validated or sanitized. This can lead to potential exploitation by an attacker controlling the username. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the 'grep' command, allowing arbitrary system commands to be executed.

The vulnerability stems from directly inserting user-input data into the system command without proper sanitization or validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use prepared statements or parameterized input to validate the username before passing it to the system command. The usage of 'exec()' or 'system()' should be avoided when dealing with user-provided data, as they are inherently vulnerable to command injection attacks. Consider using system-independent methods like '.Posix.php' to achieve similar results.

The best mitigation approach would be to separate the command execution into multiple steps or avoid using shell execution methods when dealing with external input. For example, use native PHP functions like 'posix_getpgrp()' or 'posix_getuid()' to achieve similar results.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 

```php
//assume getCurrentUser() returns a username that is guaranteed to be alphanumeric (avoiding CWE-78)
$userName = getCurrentUser();$command = 'ps aux | grep ' . $userName;system($command);
```
