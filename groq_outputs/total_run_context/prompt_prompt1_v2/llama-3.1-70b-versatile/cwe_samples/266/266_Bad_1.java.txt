VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Broadcast receiver vulnerabilities due to sending broadcasts with file URIs.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet sends a broadcast with an Intent that contains a file URI and grants read permission to the URI. This vulnerability allows any app to read the data at the file URI, potentially leading to data leaks. This is due to the fact that granting FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION to a URI allows any app that receives the Intent to access the URI, which may not be intended.

Additionally, sending broadcasts with file URIs can also lead to other security issues, such as allowing malicious apps to infer the existence or contents of sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more secure method to share data, such as:

1. Using a different Intent mechanism, like startService() for local communication or PendingIntent for more complex use cases.
2. Using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for sending notifications or data to applications.
3. If broadcasts are necessary, consider using local broadcasts or receivers registered programmatically in your app, which will not be visible to other applications.
4. Avoid granting the FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION flag when sending broadcasts, especially with file URIs.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction("com.example.BackupUserData");intent.setData(file_uri);intent.addFlags(FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);sendBroadcast(intent);
