VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. This vulnerability occurs when user input is used to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. In this case, the code takes a request parameter "reportName" and appends it to a fixed path "/usr/local/apfr/reports/". An attacker can manipulate the "reportName" parameter to traverse up the directory hierarchy and potentially delete sensitive files outside the intended directory.

For example, if an attacker sends a request with the parameter "reportName" set to something like../../../etc/passwd, they may be able to delete the /etc/passwd file, leading to significant security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, proper validation and sanitization of the user input should be performed before using it to construct the file path. Here are the recommended steps:

1. Validate the input: Ensure that the input "reportName" adheres to a specific format or pattern. In this case, it should be a file name without any directory traversal characters (./../).

2. Sanitize the input: Use a white-list approach to allow only specific characters in the input. For example, use a regular expression to match the input against a pattern that only allows alphanumeric characters and certain special characters (like hyphen, underscore, etc.).

3. Implement canonicalization: Convert the input to a canonical form before using it to construct the file path. This can help prevent directory traversal attacks.

Here is an example of how the vulnerable line can be fixed:

```java
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
// Validate and sanitize the input
if (!rName.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-.]+")) {
    // Handle invalid input
} else {
    File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);
    // ...
    rFile.delete();
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);
...rFile.delete();
