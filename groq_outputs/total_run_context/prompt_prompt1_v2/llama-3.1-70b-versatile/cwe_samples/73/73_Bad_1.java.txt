VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
File Input/Output Operation with Potential Path Traversal and Lack of Error Handling

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents a potential vulnerability due to the direct inclusion of user-defined input (`cfg.getProperty("sub")`) in the file path. This could lead to a path traversal attack if an attacker can manipulate the value of "sub" to point to a file outside the intended directory. Furthermore, the code lacks error handling for file input/output operations, which could result in the exposure of sensitive information or unexpected behavior if an error occurs.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Validate and sanitize the input for `cfg.getProperty("sub")` to prevent path traversal attacks. Ensure that it is properly sanitized and secure.
- Implement proper error handling for file input/output operations using try-catch blocks to prevent exposure of sensitive information or unexpected behavior in case of errors.
- Use a secure method to read files, such as using a `BufferedReader` or `Scanner`, and check for potential errors or edge cases.

ORIGINAL CODE:
fis = new FileInputStream(cfg.getProperty("sub")+".txt");ampa = fis.read(arr);out.println(arr);
