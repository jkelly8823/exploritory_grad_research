VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet includes a command to update Azure storage logging using the Azure CLI. The command contains authentication credentials (`--account-key`) which are hardcoded and potentially exposed in the code. Hardcoding sensitive credentials in code can lead to severe security breaches and unauthorized access to data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables: Store sensitive credentials as environment variables and retrieve them in the code. This way, even if the code is exposed, the credentials will not be compromised.
2. Use Azure Active Directory (AAD): Use AAD to authenticate with Azure Storage instead of account key. This provides a more secure and manageable way to handle authentication.
3. Use a secure configuration file or key vault: Store sensitive credentials in a secure configuration file or a key vault and load them at runtime.

ORIGINAL CODE:
az storage logging update --account-name --account-key --services b --log rwd --retention 90
