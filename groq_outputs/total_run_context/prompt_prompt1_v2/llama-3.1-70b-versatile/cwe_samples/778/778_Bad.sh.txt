VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is for updating the Azure Storage logging settings. However, it contains hardcoded sensitive information in the form of the account key (--account-key). Hardcoding sensitive information like this directly in the command line is a security vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the account key, it's recommended to use Azure's recommended practice of securely storing the account key using managed identity or environment variables. Here's a revised example:

 az storage logging update --account-name --service-principal {service_principal_id} --key {your_storage_key} --services b --log d --retention 90

Alternatively, you could use Azure CLI's secure login and role assignment to authenticate without exposing the account key.

ORIGINAL CODE:
az storage logging update --account-name --account-key --services b --log d --retention 90
