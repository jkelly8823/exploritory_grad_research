VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 XML Injection vulnerability due to the use of a non-hardcoded audit log location.

EXPLANATION:
 This code snippet contains a potential XML injection vulnerability in the `serviceSecurityAudit` element. The `auditLogLocation` attribute is set to "Default", which might allow an attacker to inject arbitrary XML content and manipulate the audit logging behavior. Although the code snippet seems incomplete, this setting could be exploited by an attacker if it is not validated or sanitized. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 To fix this vulnerability, consider the following:
 1. Validate and sanitize the `auditLogLocation` attribute to ensure it only accepts expected values.
 2. Consider hardcoding the `auditLogLocation` attribute to a known, trusted value instead of making it configurable.
 3. Implement additional logging and auditing measures to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
