Insecure Login Handling

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to handle a login function but does not check for or handle any potential errors. The 'LoginUser()' function seems to be boolean in nature, only providing a yes or no result. However, it can still fail due to other issues, for example, a database query or network failure. This implies that 'LoginUser()' could throw exceptions rather than simply returning a boolean, and thus should be wrapped in a try-catch block to prevent crashes when a failure is encountered.

Furthermore, even if an exception handling approach is employed, potential timing side-channels are created if two distinct code paths occur depending on successful authentication. An attacker might exploit this with careful time measurements, possibly to execute a timing-based attack. Based on provided code it would appear that this could potentially be prevented. To secure the handling, one must revisit this area of the code with these problem points in consideration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
(1) Wrap the 'LoginUser()' function in a try-catch block to prevent the program from crashing when an exception occurs. 
(2) Ensure that a consistent amount of time is taken to process authentication attempts regardless of success or failure to prevent timing-based side-channel attacks.
(3) Include validation to verify the authentication response from 'LoginUser()' for accuracy in later blocks of code, to catch if any exceptions arise there as well.

ORIGINAL CODE:
if LoginUser(){
   // Login successful
   RunProgram();
} else {
   // Login unsuccessful
   LoginRetry();
}
