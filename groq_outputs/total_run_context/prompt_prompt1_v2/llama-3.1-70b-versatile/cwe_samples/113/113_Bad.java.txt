VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to the direct inclusion of untrusted user input (from the `request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM)` method) into a cookie.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet directly takes user input from the request parameter `AUTHOR_PARAM` and sets it as the value of a cookie named `author`. This is an insecure practice as it allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. An attacker could potentially send a malicious request with a crafted `author` parameter that contains JavaScript code. When the cookie is set with this malicious value, the attacker's code will be executed in the context of the user's browser, allowing them to steal sensitive data, perform unauthorized actions, or take control of the user's session.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input data: Validate that the input data meets the expected format and content. Sanitize the input data by encoding or filtering out any malicious characters.
2. Use a library or framework that provides XSS protection: Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in XSS protection, such as OWASP ESAPI or OWASP WebGoat.
3. Set the `HttpOnly` flag on the cookie: Setting the `HttpOnly` flag on the cookie will prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String author = request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM);
... Cookie cookie = new Cookie("author", author);
cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```

Example of a fixed code snippet:
```java
String author = request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM);
if (author != null) {
    // Sanitize and validate the author parameter
    String sanitizedAuthor = HtmlUtils.htmlEscape(author);
    if (sanitizedAuthor.matches(^[a-zA-Z ]+]) { // assuming only letters and spaces are allowed
        Cookie cookie = new Cookie("author", sanitizedAuthor);
        cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);
        cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
        response.addCookie(cookie);
    }
}
```
