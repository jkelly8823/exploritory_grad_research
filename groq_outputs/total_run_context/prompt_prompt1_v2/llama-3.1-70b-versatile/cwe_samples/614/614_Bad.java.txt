VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Cookie Transmission
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presented creates a new cookie and adds it to the response without specifying the secure flag. This allows the cookie to be transmitted over an insecure connection (HTTP), which makes it vulnerable to interception by an attacker using techniques such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the secure flag should be set when creating the cookie. This can be achieved by adding the following parameter when creating the cookie: `c.setSecure(true);` Additionally, the cookie should be set as HTTPOnly to prevent JavaScript access: `c.setHttpOnly(true);` It is also recommended to set the SameSite attribute to mitigate cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, but this is not directly related to insecure cookie transmission.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  Cookie c = new Cookie(ACCOUNT_ID, acctID);response.addCookie(c);
                   

Note: The Secure and HTTPOnly flags ensure the cookie is transmitted securely over HTTPS and that JavaScript has no access to the cookie. Although not visible in this snippet, it is also recommended to ensure that the cookie is being set on an HTTPS connection.
