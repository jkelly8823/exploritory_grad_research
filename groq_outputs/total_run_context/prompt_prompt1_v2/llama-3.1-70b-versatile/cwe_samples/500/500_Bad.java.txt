VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive data in source code.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a public static string variable `appPropertiesFile` with a hardcoded path to a sensitive configuration file (Application.properties). This can pose a security risk if the configuration file contains sensitive information, as an attacker with access to the source code could potentially exploit this knowledge.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the path to the configuration file, consider the following options:
1. Use an environment variable: Set an environment variable containing the path to the configuration file. This way, the value can be changed without modifying the source code and is not exposed through source code access.
2. Use a secure configuration mechanism: Implement a more secure configuration mechanism, such as encrypting sensitive values or loading configuration from a separate, secure location.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  public class SomeAppClass {
                        
                           public static String appPropertiesFile = "app/Application.properties";...
                     }
               
Additional recommendations:

* If the path to the configuration file must be hardcoded for some reason, consider storing it in a separate constants file, accessible only to trusted personnel.
* Consider implementing access controls or encryption for the Application.properties file to minimize potential risks if its contents are exposed.
