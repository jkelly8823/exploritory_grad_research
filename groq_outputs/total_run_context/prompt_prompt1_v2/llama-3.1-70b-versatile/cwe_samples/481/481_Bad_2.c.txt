VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
In the given code snippet, there is a potential vulnerability in the called() function where a single equals sign is used for comparison instead of a double equals sign. This is known as an assignment in condition error.

EXPLANATION:
The bug occurs in the called() function, where foo=1 should be foo==1. The condition statement is not actually comparing the value of foo, but rather setting foo to 1 and then always executing. This means the line after the if statement will always be executed because the result of the assignment is 1, which in a boolean context is true.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this bug, you should use a double equals (==) for comparison, not a single equals (=). The corrected code should look like this:

```c
void called(int foo){if (foo==1) printf("foo\n");}int main() {
  /* ... */
  called(2);
  return 0;
}
```

This change ensures that the if statement checks the actual value of foo, not setting it and evaluating that result.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void called(int foo){if (foo=1) printf("foo\n");}int main() {
  /* ... */
  called(2);return 0;
}
```
