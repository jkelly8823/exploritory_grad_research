VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out of bounds array access in error path

EXPLANATION:
The given code attempts to validate whether the array index is within bounds by checking if the index is less than the array length. However, in the error path (else statement), it prints an error message and attempts to access the array at the index that is out of bounds, thereby causing an out-of-bounds array access vulnerability. This can lead to undefined behavior, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should not attempt to access the array at the index when the index is out of bounds. Instead, it can simply print or handle the error without accessing the array.

Here's a recommended fix for the vulnerable lines:
```c
else {
    printf("Error: Array index is out of bounds\n");
    value = -1;
}
```
Alternatively, the error message can also be modified to remove the array access:
```c
else {
    printf("Error: Array index is out of bounds\n");
    value = -1;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    
    int value;
    
    // check that the array index is less than the maximum
    // length of the array
    if (index < len) {
 
        // get the value at the specified index of the array
        value = array[index];
    }
    // if array index is invalid then output error message
    // and return value indicating error
    else {printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);value = -1;}
    return value;
}
```
