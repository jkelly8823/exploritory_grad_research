VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a recursive function with no base case, leading to a potential stack overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The `do_something_recursive` function calls itself recursively when the `flg` parameter is true. However, the value of `flg` is never modified within the function, causing an infinite recursion. This will lead to a stack overflow, as each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack without removing any existing layers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a base case should be added to the recursive function to stop the recursion when a certain condition is met. In this case, the `flg` parameter should be decremented or modified in some way to eventually become false, stopping the recursion. Here is an updated version of the code snippet with a potential fix:

```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    if (flg == 0) { return; } // base case
    ... // Do some real work here
    flg--;
    do_something_recursive (flg);
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
Alternatively, the recursive function could be rewritten as an iterative function to avoid the use of recursion altogether.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    ... // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // flg is never modified so it is always TRUE - this call will continue until the stack explodes
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
