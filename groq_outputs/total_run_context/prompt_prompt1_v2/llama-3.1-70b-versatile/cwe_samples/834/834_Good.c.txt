VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Recursive Function Call Without Termination Condition

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a recursive function call without a proper termination condition. Although the comment mentions that the function call returns when `flg` changes to 0, the recursive call itself does not decrement the `flg` variable. This can lead to infinite recursion, resulting in a stack overflow error. Furthermore, the recursive call does not check for a base case to stop the recursion.

However, there might be an implicit assumption that some other line (missing in this snippet) is actually decrementing the `flg` value to avoid infinite recursion. Nevertheless, considering the visible code only, this function is vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid this vulnerability, a base case should be explicitly added to stop the recursion. One possible fix could be to pass `flg - 1` to the recursive call:
```
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    // Do some real work here
    if (flg > 0) { 
        do_something_recursive (flg - 1); 
    }
}
```
Additionally, consider adding error checking and handling to ensure the function does not enter an infinite recursion.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    // Do some real work here
    // Modify value of flg on done condition
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // returns when flg changes to 0
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
