VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure assignment operator used within conditional statement.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a single equals sign '=' within a conditional statement, which is an assignment operator. This operator assigns the result of SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) to the variable 'cert' and then evaluates the assigned value as a boolean. This is not a comparison operation and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the assignment operation returns a value that evaluates to false in a boolean context.

However, it appears that the real issue here is related to SSL/TLS certificate verification. The code snippet does not validate the certificate correctly, allowing potentially malicious or expired certificates to be accepted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always use the correct comparison operators for conditional statements. For example, in this case, it should be 'if (cert == SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)))'.
2. Properly handle SSL/TLS certificate verification. In this case, we only check for X509_V_OK or X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED. More checks should be added to handle other potential issues.
3. Use secure coding practices and avoid shortcuts in conditional statements that may lead to security vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))
    // do stuff
}
```
