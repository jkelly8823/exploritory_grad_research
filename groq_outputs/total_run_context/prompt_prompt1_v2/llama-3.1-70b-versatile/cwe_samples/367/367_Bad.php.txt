VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `file_get_contents` function to read the contents of a file. However, the variable `$realFile` is not defined within this function scope. We suspect it should be `$filename` instead. Assuming that is the case, this function does not properly validate the file path provided by the `readlink` function, which can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could potentially manipulate the symbolic link to point to a sensitive file, allowing them to read its contents.

Additionally, there is no input validation or sanitization on the `$filename` variable. If an attacker can control this variable, they could potentially use it to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate and sanitize the file path. Here are some recommendations:

1. Replace `$realFile` with `$filename` to ensure the correct variable is being used.
2. Use absolute paths and canonicalize the file path to prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Validate the `$filename` variable to ensure it does not contain sensitive information or paths.
4. Use a whitelist approach to ensure that only authorized files can be accessed.
5. Consider using a safer alternative to `file_get_contents`, such as `fopen` or `file` functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  function readFile($filename){
                        $user = getCurrentUser();
                           
                           //resolve file if its a symbolic link
                           if(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}
                           if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}
                     }
