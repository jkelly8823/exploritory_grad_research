VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference / Unvalidated Cookie Usage
EXPLANATION:
The code assigns the `userRole` variable directly based on the value of a cookie named "role". This is vulnerable to cookie tampering attacks, where an attacker could modify the cookie value to impersonate a different role, potentially leading to unauthorized access. This code does not validate the value of the "role" cookie before assigning it to the `userRole` variable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

* Validate the value of the `userRole` variable before assigning it. For example, you could compare it against a list of valid roles.
* Consider using a more secure method of storing and validating user roles, such as storing the role in a secure session or database.
* Implement additional security controls to prevent unauthorized access, such as IP blocking or rate limiting.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();for (int i =0; i< cookies.length; i++) {Cookie c = cookies[i];if (c.getName().equals("role")) {userRole = c.getValue();}}
```
