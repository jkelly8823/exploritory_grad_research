VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Direct Object Reference (Insecure Direct Object Reference) or Unvalidated/Sanitized Input to a Security-Critical Operation due to lack of input validation on user inputs $user and $pass.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet directly assigns user input from the $_POST superglobal array to variables $user and $pass. This input is then passed to the login_user function, which presumably authenticates the user. However, without proper input validation and sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious input that may lead to security issues.

The lack of validation and sanitization enables various potential attacks such as:

1.  Authentication bypass attempts: An attacker might attempt to inject malicious input in $user and $pass, hoping to bypass authentication.
2.  Input-based attacks: Failing to validate or sanitize input leaves the application open to input-based attacks such as SQL injection or command injection, especially if the login_user function interacts with databases or system commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Input validation and sanitization should be performed on $user and $pass before passing them to the login_user function. 

Here's an example recommendation:

```php
//Validate input
if (filter_var($user, FILTER_VALIDATE_STRING, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING) !== false && 
    filter_var($pass, FILTER_VALIDATE_STRING, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING) !== false) {
    //Input is valid; proceed with authentication
    if (login_user($user,$pass)) {
        $authorized = true;
    }
} else {
    //Handle invalid input; do not proceed with authentication
}
```

In this example recommendation, `filter_var` function is used to validate input as a string and then sanitize it to prevent injections.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
```
