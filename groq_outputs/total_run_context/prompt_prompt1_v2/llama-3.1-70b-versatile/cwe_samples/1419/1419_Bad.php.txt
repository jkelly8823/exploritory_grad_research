VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection if the `login_user` function is not properly sanitized, due to directly passing user input to the function.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet accepts `$user` and `$pass` directly from a POST request. Although we can't confirm the implementation of the `login_user` function, the vulnerability report is generated under the assumption that this function performs a database query and uses these user provided inputs. The immediate concern is that an attacker could manipulate the input data to execute malicious SQL commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the implementation of the `login_user` function and ensure it properly sanitizes and escapes user input.
2. Use prepared statements when executing database queries with user-provided input. This can be achieved through libraries like PDO or mysqli with prepared statements.
3. Limit potential input data to reduce the exploit surface. Implement password policies to prevent certain characters or patterns.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                    // $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
                    if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
                    ...
                    
                  if ($authorized) {generatePage();}
