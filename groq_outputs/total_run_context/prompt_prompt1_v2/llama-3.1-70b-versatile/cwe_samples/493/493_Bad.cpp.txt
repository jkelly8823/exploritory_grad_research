VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive data
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a hard-coded file path to a sensitive configuration file. This can be a vulnerability because it exposes the location of sensitive information on the system. An attacker who gains access to the system could potentially exploit this information and gain unauthorized access to the configuration file. Additionally, hardcoding file paths can make the code less flexible and more difficult to maintain.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the file path, consider using environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information. This will make it easier to rotate or update sensitive data without having to modify the code. Additionally, consider using a more secure location for storing the configuration file, such as an encrypted volume or a separate, hardened repository.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public string configPath = "/etc/application/config.dat";
