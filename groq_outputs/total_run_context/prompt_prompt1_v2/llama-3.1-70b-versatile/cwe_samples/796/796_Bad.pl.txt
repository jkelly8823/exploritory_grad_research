VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability due to Inadequate Input Sanitization
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a path traversal vulnerability due to inadequate input sanitization. The GetUntrustedInput() function retrieves user-supplied data, which is then filtered to remove only the "../" pattern at the beginning of the string. However, this filtering is insufficient to prevent path traversal attacks.

The vulnerability lies in lines 2 and 3, where the input string is not thoroughly sanitized. This allows an attacker to provide a path traversal payload, such as "/../sensitive/file", which could bypass the filter and result in access to sensitive files outside the intended directory.

Additionally, line 4 uses the unsanitized input to construct a file path, which is then used to read and send the file. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or even code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, implement more robust input sanitization and validation. Here are some recommendations:

1. Validate the input string against a whitelist of allowed characters and lengths.
2. Remove all directory traversal patterns from the input string, not just the "../" pattern at the beginning.
3. Use a more secure function to read and send files, such as one that allows you to specify the directory or restrict access to a specific set of files.
4. Use prepared file paths or template-based file paths to avoid string concatenation.

Example of a more secure implementation:

```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/:\/\.\.\///g;  # Remove any traversal patterns
$Username =~ s/^\///g;  # Remove leading slashes
$Username =~ s/\/+$//g;  # Remove trailing slashes
my $filename = "/home/user/${Username}.txt";  # Use prepared file path
ReadAndSendFileSafe($filename);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/^\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
