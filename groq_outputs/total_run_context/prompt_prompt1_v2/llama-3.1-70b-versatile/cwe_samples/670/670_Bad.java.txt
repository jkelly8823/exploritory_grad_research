VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unattended Fall-Through in a Switch Statement.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a switch statement that does not use 'break' statements after each case. In most programming languages, the 'break' statement is used to exit the switch statement, and when not provided, the control falls through to the next case. This can result in unexpected behavior, as all the remaining cases after the matched case will also be executed. In this case, regardless of the month provided, the code will print all the months from the matched month down to December, followed by " is a great month".

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use the 'break' statement after each case to prevent fall-through. It's also better to handle the default case to handle any unexpected inputs. Here is a corrected version of the code snippet:

```java
public void printMessage(int month){
switch (month) {
case 1: print("January"); break;
case 2: print("February"); break;
case 3: print("March"); break;
case 4: print("April"); break;
case 5: print("May"); break;
case 6: print("June"); break;
case 7: print("July"); break;
case 8: print("August"); break;
case 9: print("September"); break;
case 10: print("October"); break;
case 11: print("November"); break;
case 12: print("December"); break;
default: print("Invalid month"); break;
}
println(" is a great month");
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public void printMessage(int month){
switch (month) {
case 1: print("January");case 2: print("February");case 3: print("March");case 4: print("April");case 5: print("May");case 6: print("June");case 7: print("July");case 8: print("August");case 9: print("September");case 10: print("October");case 11: print("November");case 12: print("December");
}
println(" is a great month");
}
```
