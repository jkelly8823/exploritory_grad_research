VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Blind Command Injection vulnerability, potentially via a Redirect Attack.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses user-provided input (`$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`) to make decisions and redirects the user to a URL (`$errorPageURL`) without proper validation or encoding. An attacker could manipulate the request headers to inject malicious input, potentially leading to a redirect attack. Additionally, the `$errorPageURL` variable is not defined in this snippet, which may indicate that it's dynamically generated or user-provided, increasing the risk of injection.

The main concern is that the `http_redirect($errorPageURL)` function is called conditionally based on user-provided input, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that `$errorPageURL` is a trusted, static URL.
2. Validate user-provided input (e.g., `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`) to prevent any suspicious patterns.
3. Consider using `header()` function instead of `http_redirect()` and ensure that it's called unconditionally to prevent potential injection attacks.
4. Implement proper error handling and consider logging unauthorized access attempts.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){
    echo "You are not authorized to view this page";
    http_redirect($errorPageURL);
}
$status = getServerStatus();
echo $status;
