VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information (Hardcoded Passwords)
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains plaintext passwords for user authentication, which is a serious vulnerability. Hardcoding passwords directly into source code or configuration files can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. Moreover, plaintext passwords are directly accessible if an attacker gains read-only access to the code or data files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:
- Store passwords securely using a salted hash and store only the hashed values.
- Use a secrets management solution to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.
- Use environmental variables or configuration files that are not committed to version control to store passwords securely.
- Never commit password values to source code or store them in plaintext.
