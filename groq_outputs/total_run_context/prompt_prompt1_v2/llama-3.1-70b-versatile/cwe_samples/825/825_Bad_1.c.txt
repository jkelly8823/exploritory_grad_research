VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
Although this code does not explicitly show two calls to `free`, the use of `free(ptr)` in two separate locations implies that this can potentially happen if the code snippet is part of a larger control flow. 
In C, `free` is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated. When memory is freed, it is returned to the operating system, and any future calls to `free` on that memory location will result in undefined behavior. This can cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It would be better to use a single call to `free` and structure the control flow to ensure this is always the case. If the pointer `ptr` can be used after the `if` block, consider moving the `free(ptr)` call to a location where it is guaranteed to be the last time the memory is accessed. Alternatively, use a boolean variable to track whether `ptr` has been freed and prevent the second call to `free` from happening.

```
  boolean ptr_freed = false; 
  char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {if (!ptr_freed) {free(ptr);ptr_freed = true;}}...if (!ptr_freed) {free(ptr);ptr_freed = true;}
```

Alternatively, using RAII principles can help avoid double free vulnerabilities.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
```
