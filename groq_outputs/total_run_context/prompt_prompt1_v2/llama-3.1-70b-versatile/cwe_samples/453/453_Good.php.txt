VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Direct User Input Used Without Sanitization
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is vulnerable because it directly uses user input from the `$_POST` superglobal without proper sanitization or validation. This directly passes user-provided values to the `login_user` function, which could potentially be used to inject malicious data or SQL queries.

The use of `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` without validation or sanitization allows an attacker to potentially:
- Perform SQL Injection attacks if the `login_user` function uses these values in SQL queries
- Inject malicious data or code into the application
- Authenticate as a different user by bypassing any existing security checks

The lack of validation or sanitization on user input is a significant vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious actors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks
- Validate and sanitize all user input using techniques such as whitelist validation or HTML escaping
- Consider using a framework or library that provides built-in security features and best practices
- Store passwords securely using a strong hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication or rate limiting

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];
$pass = $_POST['pass'];
$authorized = false;
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {
    $authorized = true;
}
```
Note: Without more information about the `login_user` function, it is difficult to provide more specific recommendations. However, based on the provided snippet, it is clear that user input is not being properly validated or sanitized, which is a significant vulnerability.
