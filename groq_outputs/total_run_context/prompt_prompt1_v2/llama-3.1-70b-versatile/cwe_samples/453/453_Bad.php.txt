VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unauthenticated and potentially unsanitized user input is used in the login process.

EXPLANATION:
The segment of code shows that user input ($user and $pass) is used directly in the login_user function. However, there is no indication that this data is sanitized or validated to prevent potential SQL injection attacks or other types of exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is highly recommended to validate and sanitize user input before using it in any operation. This can include checking the format and content of the input data and removing any potentially malicious characters. Additionally, consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements in SQL operations to prevent SQL injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
...
if ($authorized) {generatePage();}
```
