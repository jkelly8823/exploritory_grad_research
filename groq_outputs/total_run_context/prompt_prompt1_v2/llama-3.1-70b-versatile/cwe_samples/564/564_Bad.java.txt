VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a SQL Injection attack due to the concatenation of user input into a SQL query string.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes user input from `getStreetFromUser()` and directly appends it to a SQL query string. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `street` variable. For example, if the attacker inputs a street name with a syntax similar to SQL (e.g., `Robert'); DROP TABLE Students; --`), they can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches or system exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to use a parameterized query instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL query string. This ensures that the user input is treated as data and not as part of the SQL code.

Here's an example of how to fix the code:
```
String street = getStreetFromUser();
Query query = session.createQuery("from Address a where a.street = :street");
query.setParameter("street", street);
```
Alternatively, you can use `Criteria` or `HQL` with parameter binding to achieve the same level of protection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String street = getStreetFromUser();Query query = session.createQuery("from Address a where a.street='" + street + "'");
```
