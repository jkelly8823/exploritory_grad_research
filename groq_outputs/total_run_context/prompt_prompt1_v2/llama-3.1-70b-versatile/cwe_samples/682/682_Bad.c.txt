VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack in the allocation of memory for the `table_ptr` structure.

EXPLANATION:
In the code snippet, the `num_imgs` variable is used to allocate memory for an array of `img_t` structures using `malloc`. However, the `num_imgs` variable is not validated or checked for any potential overflows before being used to allocate memory. 

If `num_imgs` is a very large value, the product `sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs` could overflow the maximum value that can be represented by the system's type (typically `size_t`), potentially resulting in an integer overflow. In this scenario, `malloc` could allocate much less memory than expected or even a negative amount of memory, leading to undefined behavior when trying to access or manipulate the allocated memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `num_imgs` value is validated and checked for potential overflows before using it to allocate memory. 

1. Verify the validity of `num_imgs` by checking its range and ensuring it does not exceed a reasonable limit. 

```c
if (num_imgs <= 0) {
    // handle invalid input or error
}
```

2. Use multiplication overflow detection to prevent integer overflows.

```c
size_t neededMemory = sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs;
if (neededMemory / sizeof(img_t) != num_imgs) {
    // overflow detected, handle it accordingly
}
```

3. Consider using calloc to zero out the allocated memory to prevent leakage of sensitive data.

```c
table_ptr = (img_t*)calloc(num_imgs, sizeof(img_t));
if (table_ptr == NULL) {
    // memory allocation failed, handle it accordingly
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
```
