VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks due to the direct concatenation of user input in the path passed to `os.mkdir()`.

EXPLANATION:
In the code snippet, the `username` variable is directly concatenated to the `/home/` directory path and used as an argument for `os.mkdir()`. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious directory paths. For instance, an attacker can supply a username containing path traversal characters (e.g., `../`) to potentially create directories outside the intended `/home/` directory. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive system directories.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, validate the `username` variable to ensure it only contains valid characters, such as alphanumeric characters and certain special characters. Also, use `os.path.join()` to safely join the directory path and the username. Here's a recommended fix:

```python
import os

def makeNewUserDir(username):
    if invalidUsername(username):
        print('Usernames cannot contain invalid characters')
        return False

    sanitized_username = ''.join(char for char in username if char.isalnum() or char in ['_', '-'])
    user_dir_path = os.path.join('/home', sanitized_username)
    try:
        raisePrivileges()
        os.mkdir(user_dir_path)
        lowerPrivileges()
    except OSError:
        print('Unable to create new user directory for user: ' + username)
        return False
    return True
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
def makeNewUserDir(username):
    if invalidUsername(username):
        print('Usernames cannot contain invalid characters')
        return False
    try:raisePrivileges()os.mkdir('/home/' + username)lowerPrivileges()
    except OSError:print('Unable to create new user directory for user:' + username)return False
    return True
```
