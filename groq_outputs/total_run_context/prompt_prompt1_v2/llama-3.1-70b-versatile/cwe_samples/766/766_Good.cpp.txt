VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code stores a password in a plain text format as a character array.

EXPLANATION:
Storing passwords in plain text is a serious vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to access user credentials if the system is compromised. This practice is insecure because it does not protect against insider threats, nor against physical attacks on the system (e.g., through backups). Modern authentication systems should never store passwords in plain text, and should always use secure hashed password storage mechanisms.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Hash and salt passwords before storing them. This should be done with a strong, well-established password hashing algorithm, such as Argon2 or PBKDF2.

ORIGINAL CODE:
private: char* password;
