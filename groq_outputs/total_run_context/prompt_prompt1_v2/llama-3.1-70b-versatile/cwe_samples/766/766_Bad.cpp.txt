VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present due to the use of a plain char pointer to store a password. This indicates that the password is stored in plain text, which is a security risk as it can be easily accessed by unauthorized users. Furthermore, using a char pointer can lead to issues with buffer management and the risk of buffer overflows.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use a secure string class**: Instead of using a char pointer, consider using a secure string class that provides mechanisms for safe password storage. Examples include `std::string` or `boost::crypto::basic_string_ref`.
2. **Use a secure password storage mechanism**: Instead of storing passwords in plain text, consider using a secure password storage mechanism that stores passwords securely, such as hashing and salting the password. This will prevent unauthorized access to the password.
3. **Use a secure memory allocation mechanism**: Instead of using raw pointers, consider using smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to manage memory allocation and deallocation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
public: char* password;
