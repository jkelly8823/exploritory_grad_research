VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leakage vulnerability due to unhandled socket closure.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet shows a ServerSocket and a Socket being initialized in the StockSymbolBean constructor. The ServerSocket is created on a specified port and the clientSocket is accepted from the serverSocket. However, there are potential resource leakage issues. 

The serverSocket and clientSocket are not closed in case of exceptions or after use, which can cause the socket resource to be held indefinitely. This issue is known as a resource leakage vulnerability. 

In a server application, this can lead to denial of service (DoS) as the server may eventually run out of available sockets.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the serverSocket and clientSocket are properly closed after use, even if exceptions occur. This can be achieved by using try-with-resources or try-finally blocks. Here is a recommended fix:

```java
public StockSymbolBean() {
    try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT)) {
        try (Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept()) {
            // use clientSocket
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // handle exception
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use try-finally blocks to ensure the sockets are closed:

```java
public StockSymbolBean() {
    ServerSocket serverSocket = null;
    Socket clientSocket = null;
    try {
        serverSocket = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT);
        clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
        // use clientSocket
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // handle exception
    } finally {
        if (clientSocket != null) {
            try {
                clientSocket.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // handle close exception
            }
        }
        if (serverSocket != null) {
            try {
                serverSocket.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // handle close exception
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Both of these approaches will ensure that the sockets are properly closed after use, preventing resource leakage vulnerabilities.

        try {serverSocket = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT);} catch (IOException ex) {...}
