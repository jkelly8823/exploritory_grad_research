VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a regular expression to validate the `$name` variable. The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` contains nested repetition operators. This can lead to a catastrophic backtracking scenario, where the regular expression engine enters an exponential time complexity, consuming excessive system resources and potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or ReDoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid this vulnerability, consider rewriting the regular expression to avoid nested repetition operators. Here's an example of a safer alternative:

`if ($name =~ /^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*$/)`

This revised regular expression still matches the same pattern (a string starting with an alphanumeric character, followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or hyphens) but avoids the potential for catastrophic backtracking.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) ...
```
