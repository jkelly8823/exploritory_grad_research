VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a Command Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet directly concatenates user input ($userName) into a system command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the "user" POST parameter. An attacker could inject malicious commands that can compromise the security of the system. This vulnerability arises because the user input is not validated or sanitized, and the `system` function executes commands in the shell.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize all user input data to ensure it conforms to expected formats. In this case, ensure that $userName only contains alphanumeric characters and does not include any malicious characters.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent command injection.
3. Avoid using the `system` function whenever possible, as it is a built-in function that can be used to execute arbitrary system commands. Instead, use built-in PHP functions that provide the needed functionality, such as `scandir()` or `opendir()` to list directory contents.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$userName = $_POST["user"];$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;system($command);
