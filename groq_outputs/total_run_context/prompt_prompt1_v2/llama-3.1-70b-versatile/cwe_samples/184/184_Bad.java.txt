Insecure Regular Expression Usage

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the `replaceAll` method with a hardcoded regular expression pattern to remove HTML script tags from the input string. However, this approach is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. The regular expression "script" can cause catastrophic backtracking when the input string contains a large number of occurrences of the characters 's', 'c', 'r', 'i', 'p', and 't'. This can lead to a significant performance decrease and potentially cause the application to become unresponsive.

Moreover, this approach does not actually remove HTML script tags but merely replaces the word "script" with the provided mask. This can lead to incorrect removal of valid content and may not effectively prevent XSS attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more specific and efficient regular expression pattern that actually matches the HTML script tags. For example, `<script[^>]*>.*?<\/script>` can be used to match and remove HTML script tags.
2. Use the `Pattern.DOTALL` flag to ensure that the dot (.) matches newline characters, allowing for correct removal of multiline script tags.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides a robust way to parse and sanitize HTML content, such as OWASP AntiSamy or Jsoup.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public String removeScriptTags(String input, String mask) {return input.replaceAll("script", mask);}
