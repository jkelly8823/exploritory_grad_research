VULNERABILITYDESCRIPTION:
Dynamic class loading from an untrusted source using a custom class loader.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses a custom class loader (`CustomClassLoader`) to dynamically load a class (identified by the string "someClass") from an unknown source. This class loading is then followed by an instantiation of the loaded class (`c.newInstance()`), and execution of methods or access to member variables. The problem with this approach is that any class can be loaded from an untrusted source, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Avoid using custom class loaders to load classes from untrusted sources. If dynamic class loading is necessary, ensure that the source of the class is trusted and that the class name is properly sanitized. Additionally, it's recommended to use the `AccessController` class to provide the necessary permissions for the loaded class to operate correctly. Consider using another approach such as ServiceLoader (Java 9+) or `URLClassLoader` for dynamically loading classes from trusted sources.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
@Stateless
public class LoaderSessionBean implements LoaderSessionRemote {

    public LoaderSessionBean() {
        try {
            ClassLoader loader = new CustomClassLoader();
            Class c = loader.loadClass("someClass");
            Object obj = c.newInstance();
            /* perform some task that uses the new class instance member variables or functions */
            /*...*/
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            /*...*/
        }
    }

    public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    }
}
```
