VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to Command Injection.

EXPLANATION:
The code calls the `system` function with a string that contains user-input data (the phone number) without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the `system` function, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

In the code, the regular expression checks for digits and hyphens, but this is not sufficient to prevent command injection. An attacker can still inject malicious code by adding command separators or using escape characters to bypass the input validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly escape or sanitize the input data before passing it to the `system` function. One recommended approach is to use the `exec` function instead of `system`, which can take a list of arguments instead of a single string. This allows the code to avoid shell interpretation of the input data.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified:
```perl
$phone = GetPhoneNumber();
if ($phone =~ /\d+-\d+/) {
    # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
    my @cmd = ('lookup-phone', $phone);
    exec @cmd;
} else {
    error("malformed number!");
}
```
Alternatively, the code could use a safer approach such as using a lookup-phone API or a library that provides a safer way to perform phone lookups without using the `system` function.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
$phone = GetPhoneNumber();if ($phone =~ /\d+-\d+/) {
    # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
    system("lookup-phone $phone");}
else {error("malformed number!");}
```
