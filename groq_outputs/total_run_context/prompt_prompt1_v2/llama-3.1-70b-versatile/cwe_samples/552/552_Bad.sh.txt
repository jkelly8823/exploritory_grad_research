VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
 Command Injection Vulnerability via Unvalidated User Input.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains an Azure CLI command that updates a storage account and allows blob public access. However, the storage account name and resource group are passed directly from user input in the `<storage-account>` and `<resource-group>` placeholders, respectively, without proper validation and sanitization. This could lead to a command injection vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the input to inject malicious commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that user input for the `<storage-account>` and `<resource-group>` placeholders is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to the Azure CLI command. This can be achieved by:

* Using a whitelist to validate the storage account name and resource group.
* Escaping or encoding special characters in the input.
* Using parameterized commands instead of string concatenation.
* Implementing additional security measures, such as Azure CLI's built-in security features, to restrict and monitor access to the storage account.

ORIGINAL CODE:
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access true
