VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Overly Permissive Access Control

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet grants overly permissive access control to the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket `gs://BUCKET_NAME`. The `gsutil iam ch -d` command revokes access control lists (ACLs) for the specified entities. However, the entities specified (`allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers`) are too broad and do not follow the principle of least privilege.

 LINE 1 (`gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME`) allows anyone, regardless of their identity or association with the organization, to access the bucket.

 LINE 2 (`gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME`) grants access to anyone with a Google account, not just users within the organization.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of granting access to `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers`, grant access to specific identities or groups that require access to the GCS bucket. Use more restrictive entities, such as email addresses or service accounts. Additionally, consider using role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that principal identities have only the permissions they require.

```python
# Example RBAC Configuration
POLICY_BINDING = {
    'resources': ['gs://BUCKET_NAME'],
    'condition': None,
    'members': [
        'user:specificuser@example.com',
        'group:specialgroup@googlegroups.com'
    ],
    'roles': ['roles/storage.admin']
}
```

The above recommendation showcases assigning a more restricted access control policy with an implementation utilizing Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices. Implement the respective change commands when executing.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
