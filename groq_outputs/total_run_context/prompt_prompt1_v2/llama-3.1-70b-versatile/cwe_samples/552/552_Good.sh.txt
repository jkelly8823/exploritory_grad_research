VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a command-line interface (CLI) command for Azure Storage. However, the command is vulnerable to injection attacks since it uses user input directly. If an attacker injects malicious input in place of `<storage-account>` or `<resource-group>`, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize any user input before using it in the command. This can be done by checking the input against a white list of allowed values or using a more secure method of variable interpolation. Additionally, consider using the `--storage-account` and `--resource-group` options with hard-coded or securely generated values rather than using user input.

ORIGINAL CODE:
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access false
