VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code directly references a hardcoded bucket name.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, a direct reference to a hardcoded bucket name 'BUCKET_NAME' is used in a 'gsutil iam get' command. This is considered a vulnerability because hardcoded sensitive information can potentially leak or be intentionally exposed by an attacker, leading to unauthenticated access or other malicious actions on the bucket.

Although I'm not aware of the explicit variable assignment for 'BUCKET_NAME', considering it is followed 'gs://' notation (usually specifying a GCS (Google Cloud Storage) path), 'BUCKET_NAME' seems to represent a sensitive configuration value. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the bucket name, consider using environment variables or a secure secrets management solution to store sensitive configuration values like this. Here is a potential fix:

 gsutil iam get ${BUCKET_NAME} or gsutil iam get $BUCKET_NAME 

make sure the variable 'BUCKET_NAME' is defined securely before the command. It's essential to ensure the variable assignment is not also referencing a hard-coded or compromised value.

ORIGINAL CODE:
gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAME
