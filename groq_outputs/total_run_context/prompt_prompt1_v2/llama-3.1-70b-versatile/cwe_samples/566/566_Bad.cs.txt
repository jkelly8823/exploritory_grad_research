VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of `AddWithValue` and potential SQL Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains a potential SQL injection vulnerability. While the code correctly uses a parameterized query to prevent direct SQL injection attacks, it still uses `AddWithValue` which can potentially lead to issues if the database driver incorrectly guesses the data type of the parameter. This can lead to potential SQL injection attacks.

Additionally, there is an issue where `objCommand` is called `ExecuteReader()` but `objCommand` is never defined or declared within the code snippet provided. However, considering the context it is assumed to be the `query` variable declared in the previous line. The `System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text)` conversion does not contain any error checking to verify if the string can be successfully converted to `int16` type which could potentially throw a `FormatException` if the conversion fails.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using `AddWithValue`, use `Add` with explicit type declaration to avoid potential SQL injection attacks. It is also recommended to use `Try-Catch` block to handle any potential exceptions thrown during SQL connection or query execution. Lastly, validate the `invoiceID.Text` before converting it to `int16`.

```csharp
query.Parameters.Add("@id", SqlDbType.SmallInt).Value = id;
```

Additionally, proper exception handling and validation should be implemented. 

```csharp
try {
    int16 id = System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text);
    conn = new SqlConnection(_ConnectionString);
    conn.Open();
    SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand( "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
    query.Parameters.Add("@id", SqlDbType.SmallInt).Value = id;
    SqlDataReader objReader = query.ExecuteReader();
    //query execution logic here
} catch (FormatException ex) {
    //handle format exception here
} catch (Exception ex) {
    //handle any other exceptions here
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
conn = new SqlConnection(_ConnectionString);
conn.Open();
int16 id = System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text);
SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand( "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id);
SqlDataReader objReader = objCommand.ExecuteReader();
```
