VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential vulnerability related to the use of `JavaScriptInterface` in conjunction with `WebView`. Specifically, it allows untrusted JavaScript code to access sensitive Java methods and properties through the `JavaScriptInterface`.

EXPLANATION:
The `JavaScriptInterface` is a powerful feature in Android that allows developers to expose Java code to JavaScript, running in a `WebView`. However, this can pose a security risk if not used carefully. In this case, the `JavaScriptInterface` has a method called `getUserInfo()` which may be accessing sensitive information about the current user. An attacker who manages to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `WebView` could potentially exploit this interface to steal user data.

Moreover, in the line 4, JavaScript is enabled using `mainWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true)`. This allows JavaScript to run in the `WebView`, which, combined with the `JavaScriptInterface`, makes it possible for an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following recommendations should be considered:
1. Avoid using `JavaScriptInterface` unless necessary. If it's required, ensure that only the necessary methods are exposed.
2. Validate and sanitize any data that's passed to or from the JavaScript code.
3. Ensure that the JavaScript code running in the `WebView` comes from a trusted source.
4. Consider using the `@JavascriptInterface` annotation on methods that should be exposed to JavaScript, to ensure explicit exposure.
5. Limit the privileges of the `JavaScriptInterface` to the minimum required.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class WebViewGUI extends Activity {
    WebView mainWebView;
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);mainWebView = new WebView(this);mainWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);mainWebView.addJavascriptInterface(new JavaScriptInterface(), "userInfoObject");mainWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html");setContentView(mainWebView);}
    final class JavaScriptInterface {
        JavaScriptInterface () {}
        public String getUserInfo() {return currentUser.Info();}
    }
}
```
