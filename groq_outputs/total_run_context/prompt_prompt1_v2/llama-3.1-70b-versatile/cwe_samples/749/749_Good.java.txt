VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack because user input (databaseName) is directly concatenated into a SQL statement. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the databaseName string. An attacker could potentially drop or modify sensitive databases, access unauthorized data, or even escalate privileges.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using prepared statements with parameterized queries instead of string concatenation. This ensures that user input is treated as a literal value and not as executable SQL code. Here is a recommended fix:

```java
private void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        String query = "DROP DATABASE ?";
        PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
        pstmt.setString(1, databaseName);
        pstmt.execute();
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
```

This revised code uses a prepared statement with a parameterized query, treating the databaseName as a literal value and preventing SQL injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
private void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}}
```
