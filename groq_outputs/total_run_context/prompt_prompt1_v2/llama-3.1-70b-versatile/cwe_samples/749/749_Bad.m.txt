VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Unsanitized User Input in Dynamic Evaluation.
EXPLANATION:
The method `writeDataToView` appears to be injecting user-controlled data directly into the UIWebView. In the absence of more information about this method, it is assumed that this data is not properly sanitized and verified for safety before being injected into the web view. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript or other content into the web view, allowing them to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the web view.

Additionally, the use of `query` from the `URL` object could also introduce a vulnerability if an attacker is able to control the query string of the URL. Without proper validation and sanitization of this input, the risk of an attacker being able to inject malicious content remains.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following recommendations should be implemented:

1. Validate and sanitize any user-controlled data before injecting it into the web view. This includes data retrieved from the `query` string of the URL.

2. Verify that the `writeDataToView` method properly handles any user-controlled data to prevent the injection of malicious JavaScript.

3. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of resources that the web view can load, making it more difficult for an attacker to inject malicious content.

4. Use `WKWebView` instead of `UIWebView`, as it provides improved security features for regulating content injection.

5. Ensure that proper validation and sanitization is in place for any data being injected into the web view from the `specialFunction`.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                 // iOS
                 -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
                    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
                          NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                        
                                   
                                   // Make data available back in webview.
                                   UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
                             }return NO;
                       }return YES;
                 }
