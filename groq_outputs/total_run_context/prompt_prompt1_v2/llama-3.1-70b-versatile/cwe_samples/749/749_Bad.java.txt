VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it directly concatenates user-provided input (`databaseName`) into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `databaseName` variable. For example, an attacker could supply a value like `"mydb; DROP DATABASE sakila;"` and potentially delete multiple databases.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a prepared statement with a parameterized query instead of concatenating the input into the SQL query. This will prevent the input from being treated as part of the SQL code and reduce the risk of SQL Injection. Here's an example of how the code could be rewritten:

```java
public void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("DROP DATABASE ?");
        stmt.setString(1, databaseName);
        stmt.execute();
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
```
