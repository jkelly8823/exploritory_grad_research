VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Case statement with implicit default behavior in a FSM can cause unintended state transitions.
EXPLANATION:
This code defines a finite state machine (FSM) with a 3-bit user input and a 2-bit state register. However, the case statement inside the always block has implicit default behavior when the user input does not match any of the specified cases. This can cause the FSM to enter an unintended state. In particular, the last case statement for 3'h4, 3'h5 does not handle cases where user_input is greater than 5 or less than 0. The user_input can cause the FSM to load an incorrect state.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to explicitly define the default behavior for the case statement. This can be achieved by adding a default clause to handle all other cases that are not specified. Here is the recommended fix:

```
	case (user_input)
	// ...
	default :
	state = 2'h0; // or some other default state
	endcase
```

The default value should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the design.

ORIGINAL CODE:


module fsm_1(out, user_input, clk, rst_n);
input [2:0] user_input; 
input clk, rst_n;
output reg [2:0] out;
reg [1:0] state;
always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n )
  
begin
  
  
	if (!rst_n)
  
	state = 3'h0;
  
	else
	case (user_input)
		3'h0:
		3'h1:
		3'h2:
		3'h3: state = 2'h3;
		3'h4: state = 2'h2;
		3'h5: state = 2'h1;
	endcase
  
end
out <= {1'h1, state};
