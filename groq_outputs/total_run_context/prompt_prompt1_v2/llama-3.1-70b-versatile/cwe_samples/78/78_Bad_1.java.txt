VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
A command injection vulnerability exists because user-controlled input `coordinates` is directly executed as a command in the system through the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method. An attacker could inject malicious commands to execute on the system, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or unauthorized data access.

In this case, the code is vulnerable because it concatenates user input (`latlonCoords`) directly into the command string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the `coordinates` input. For example, if an attacker passes `coordinates` containing a semicolon (`;`) or ampersand (`&`), they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following steps:

1. Validate and sanitize the user input `coordinates` to ensure it only contains expected characters (e.g., numbers, letters, and spaces).
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input coordinates against a known format (e.g., latitude and longitude values within expected ranges).
3. Consider using a library or API to perform the coordinate transformation, rather than relying on an external executable.
4. If an external executable is necessary, use a CommandStringBuilder or a similar utility to safely construct the command string and prevent command injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public String coordinateTransformLatLonToUTM(String coordinates){
    String utmCoords = null;try {
        String latlonCoords = coordinates;Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process exec = rt.exec("cmd.exe /C latlon2utm.exe -" + latlonCoords);
            // process results of coordinate transform
            
            
            // ...
            
        
    }catch(Exception e) {...}return utmCoords;
}
```
