VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes user input from a GET parameter 'name' and uses it directly in a system command without proper sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject their own commands and execute them on the system.

In the affected lines, the 'nslookup' command is being executed with the user input 'name' as an argument. This creates the possibility for an attacker to inject malicious commands that are then executed on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the user input: Use a whitelist of allowed characters and ensuring that the input does not contain any shell special characters that could be used for injection.
2. Use a safer alternative: Consider using a library or function that can perform the 'nslookup' functionality without requiring the execution of a system command with user-supplied input.
3. Use the 'system' function with a fixed argument list: If using the 'system' function is unavoidable, make sure to specify a fixed argument list rather than interpolating the command and arguments as a string. This will help to prevent injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
use CGI qw(:standard);
$name = param('name');
$nslookup = "/path/to/nslookup";
print header;
if (open($fh, "$nslookup $name|")) {
    while (<$fh>) {
        print escapeHTML($_);
        print "<br>\n";
    }
    close($fh);
}
```
