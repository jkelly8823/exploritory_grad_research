VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection vulnerability is present in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Command Injection attack. The `request.getParameter("backuptype")` line retrieves user input and directly incorporates it into the `cmd` string without any sanitization or validation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted input that injects malicious commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

For instance, if an attacker submits the input `&whoami`, the command executed would be `cmd.exe /K "c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat &whoami&&c:\\utl\\cleanup.bat"`, which would execute the `whoami` command in addition to the intended `rmanDB.bat` and `cleanup.bat` commands.

Additionally, using `System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd)` can pose security risks, as it can execute arbitrary system commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Use whitelisting**: Validate the user input against a list of allowed values for `backuptype`.
2. **Use parameterized commands**: Instead of directly concatenating user input into the command string, use a library that supports parameterized commands or escaping of special characters.
3. **Use a safer execution method**: Consider using a higher-level library or API that provides a safer way to execute system commands, such as `ProcessBuilder` with the `redirectErrorStream` method.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
...String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");String cmd = new String("cmd.exe /K \"c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat "+btype+"&&c:\\utl\\cleanup.bat\"")
System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);...
```
