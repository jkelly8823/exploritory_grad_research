VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the line where the code checks if the canonical hostname ends with "trustme.com". This is a naive approach to determine trust, as an attacker could exploit this by configuring their DNS server to return a hostname that ends with "trustme.com", effectively bypassing the trust mechanism. 
Additionally, this code also relies on the trusted nature of the canonical hostname which is obtained from a DNS query. 
The code also assumes that the canonical hostname is always correctly set by the DNS server.

Another potential issue is that getCanonicalHostName() can throw an unknownHostException, which should be handled.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should implement a more secure way to determine trust. Here are some possible recommendations:

1. Implement a whitelist of trusted IP addresses instead of relying on the hostname.
2. Use a secure way to get the client's IP address, for example by checking if the 'X-Forwarded-For' header exists, and if so, verify its contents.
3. Handle potential exceptions and unknown host exceptions.

Here is a revised example:

```java
String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
String[] trustedIPs = new String[]{"192.0.2.1", "192.0.2.2"};

if (Arrays.asList(trustedIPs).contains(ip)) {
    trusted = true;
} else {
    // Handle the case where the IP is not trusted.
}
```

Please note that this revised example does not solve all potential security issues and you should carefully evaluate your use case and implement the solution accordingly.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {
    trusted = true;
}
```
