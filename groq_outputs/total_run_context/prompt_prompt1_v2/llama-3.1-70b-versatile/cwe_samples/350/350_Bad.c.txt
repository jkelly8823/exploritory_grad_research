VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `strncmp` function with a potentially large buffer size (`sizeof(tHost)`), which is incorrect as `sizeof(tHost)` returns the size of the `char*` pointer, not the string length.

EXPLANATION:
The `strncmp` function is used to compare a maximum number of characters between two strings. However, in this case, the third argument (`sizeof(tHost)`) is incorrectly used. The `sizeof` operator returns the size of the `char*` pointer (`tHost`), not the length of the string pointed to. This may cause the `strncmp` function to read beyond the end of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, replace `sizeof(tHost)` with `strlen(tHost)` to ensure that the correct number of characters are compared. Additionally, consider using `strcmp` instead of `strncmp` if the comparison should be done until the end of the strings.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
struct hostent *hp;struct in_addr myaddr;char* tHost = "trustme.example.com";myaddr.s_addr=inet_addr(ip_addr_string);
hp = gethostbyaddr((char *) &myaddr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);if (hp && !strncmp(hp->h_name, tHost, sizeof(tHost))) {trusted = true;} else {trusted = false;}
```
