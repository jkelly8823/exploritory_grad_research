VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in message handling

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains several issues that can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, there are two potential issues:
1. The `getMessage` function is called without checking if the amount of data received is larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`, which could result in additional data being written beyond the end of the `buffer` array, assuming `getMessage` allows the write.
2. The message body is copied from `msg->msgBody` to the `message` array using a loop that iterates up to `msg->msgLength`, without checking if `msg->msgLength` is greater than or equal to `MESSAGE_SIZE`, which could result in a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement bounds checking in `getMessage` to prevent reading beyond `BUFFER_SIZE`.
2. Implement bounds checking when copying the message body into the `message` array to prevent writing beyond `MESSAGE_SIZE`.
3. Use safer functions for string manipulation, like `strncpy` or `snprintf`, instead of manual loops.
4. Validate that `msg->msgLength` is valid (non-negative) before using it.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int processMessageFromSocket(int socket) {
    int success;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    char message[MESSAGE_SIZE];

    // get message from socket and store into buffer

    //Ignoring possibliity that buffer > BUFFER_SIZE
    if (getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE) > 0) {

        // place contents of the buffer into message structure
        ExMessage *msg = recastBuffer(buffer);

        // copy message body into string for processing
        int index;
        for (index = 0; index < msg->msgLength; index++) {
            message[index] = msg->msgBody[index];
        }
        message[index] = '\0';

        // process message
        success = processMessage(message);
    }
    return success;
}
```
