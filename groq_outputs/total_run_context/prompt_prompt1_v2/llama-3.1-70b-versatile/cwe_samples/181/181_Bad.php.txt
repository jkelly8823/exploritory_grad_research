VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Directory Traversal attack due to inadequate sanitization and validation of the `$dirName` variable.

EXPLANATION:
Although the code checks for the presence of the '..' sequence in the `$dirName` variable and prevents its creation if it is found, this check is not sufficient. The function still allows the creation of directories with names that can potentially allow an attacker to traverse outside the intended directory.

The line `$newDir = $userDir . $dirName;` directly concatenates the user-specified directory name with the user directory, creating a potential vulnerability to directory traversal attacks if the attacker is able to manipulate the `$dirName` variable. 

Furthermore, simply removing the '~' character from the `$dirName` is not sufficient to prevent an attacker from using this vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more comprehensive directory sanitization method, such as `realpath()` to ensure the directory creation is not allowed outside of the intended directory.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the `$dirName`, ensuring it only contains allowed characters and does not contain directory traversal sequences.
3. Remove the use of `strpos($dirName,'..')` and instead use a more comprehensive input validation and sanitization technique.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function createDir($userName,$dirName){
    $userDir = '/users/'. $userName;
    if(strpos($dirName,'..') !== false){
        echo 'Directory name contains invalid sequence';
        return;
    }
    //filter out '~' because other scripts identify user directories by this prefix
    $dirName = str_replace('~','',$dirName);
    $newDir = $userDir . $dirName;
    mkdir($newDir, 0700);
    chown($newDir,$userName);
}
```
