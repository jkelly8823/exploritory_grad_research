VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it uses untrusted user input ($Username) to construct a file path ($filename). Although the code attempts to remove "../" from the input, this is not sufficient to prevent path traversal attacks. A clever attacker can use other techniques such as using '..', then a trailing dot '.' to bypass the filtering, or using other directory traversal methods such as /.././.

Despite the removal of '../', an attacker could still traverse to a parent directory by exploiting the current path or using other techniques.

Moreover, the code then uses this file path to read and send a file, which could potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input. Only accept input that is known to be safe.
2. Avoid using untrusted input to construct file paths. Instead, use a mapping or storage of allowed files.
3. Implement proper directory traversal protection in your code, or use functions that don't allow directory traversal.
4. Use prepared statements and query parameters for database interactions (not applicable in this snippet but good practice in general).
5. Validate the existence of the file before accessing it.
Here is a possible alternative implementation for GetUntrustedInput and preparation of path/filename.

```perl
my @allowed_filenames = ('file1.txt', 'file2.txt');
my $input = GetUntrustedInput();
foreach my $filename (@allowed_filenames) {
   if ($input eq $filename){
       my $filepath = "/home/user/" . $filename;
       # verify existence of the file
       if (-e $filepath) {
           ReadAndSendFile($filepath);
       }
   }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput(); 
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///; 
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
