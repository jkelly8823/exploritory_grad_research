VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoding of sensitive credentials in a configuration file.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be from a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file, where sensitive credentials like the LDAP username and password are being hardcoded. This is a serious security vulnerability as these credentials are sensitive and should not be exposed in clear text. An attacker who gains access to this configuration file can use these credentials to authenticate with the LDAP server and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Instead of hardcoding sensitive credentials in the configuration file, consider using environment variables or a secure key management system to store and retrieve these credentials.
* Use a secrets manager like Hashicorp's Vault or Google Cloud's Secret Manager to securely store and retrieve sensitive credentials.
* If environment variables are used, ensure they are not stored in the codebase or configuration files and are properly cleared from the environment after use.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                     # Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
                     ...webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword...
```
