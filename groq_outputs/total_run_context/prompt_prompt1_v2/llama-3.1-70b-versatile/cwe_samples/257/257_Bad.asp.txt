VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The provided XML configuration snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, including the username ('db2admin') and password ('password'), for a database connection. These credentials should not be presented in clear text within code, as this can expose sensitive information and allow unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of hardcoding credentials directly in the configuration file, use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store and manage sensitive data.
- Consider using a secure data storage mechanism like HashiCorp's Vault or Azure Key Vault to manage and provide access to sensitive credentials.
- If a configuration file is required to contain the credentials, consider encrypting the file or using a mechanism like Azure Key Vault's configuration snippets to retrieve and decrypt the credentials.
