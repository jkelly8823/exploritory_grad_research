VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a vulnerability where a function returns a pointer to a local variable, leading to undefined behavior when the returned pointer is used.

EXPLANATION:
The `getName()` function declares a local character array `name` and returns a pointer to it. When the function returns, the local variable `name` goes out of scope, and the memory it occupied is no longer valid. However, the pointer to this memory is still returned and can be used by the caller. This leads to undefined behavior when the caller tries to access the memory pointed to by the returned pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the function should allocate memory for the returned string using dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `malloc` or `new`) and ensure that the caller is responsible for freeing the memory when it is no longer needed. Alternatively, the function can return the string by value instead of by pointer, or the string can be passed as an output parameter to the function.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  char* getName() {char name[STR_MAX];fillInName(name);return name;}
