VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack, as the return value of the `returnChunkSize` function is used to determine the size of the `memcpy` operation. If the returned value is less than 1, the `memcpy` operation will use a size that is off by 1, potentially writing past the bounds of the `destBuf` buffer.

EXPLANATION:
The `returnChunkSize` function is supposed to return the size of the usable memory in a chunk. However, in the `memcpy` operation, the size used is `returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1`, which could lead to a buffer overflow if `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns a value close to 0. This is because `memcpy` will then try to copy data to the `destBuf` with a size that is larger than the actual buffer size, potentially overwriting memory adjacent to `destBuf`.

Additionally, if `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns -1 to indicate an error, the `memcpy` operation will still be executed with a size of -2, which can also lead to undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to:

- Check the return value of `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` to ensure it is a valid size before using it in the `memcpy` operation.
- Handle the error case where `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns -1.
- Consider using `size_t` instead of `int` to handle size values to prevent negative numbers.
- Consider using `strcpy` or `strncpy` instead of `memcpy` for string operations.

```c
size_t returnChunkSize(void *) {
    // ...
}

int main() {
    size_t chunkSize = returnChunkSize(destBuf);
    if (chunkSize > 0) {
        memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, chunkSize);
    } else {
        // Handle error case
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int returnChunkSize(void *) {
    // ...
}

int main() {
    // ...
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));
    // ...
}
```
