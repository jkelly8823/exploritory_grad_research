VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present in this code is a potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code clears the "os.name" system property and immediately tries to retrieve the same property. This can cause issues if the property is being accessed from multiple threads, as clearing the property can leave other threads with a null reference, potentially causing a NullPointerException. However, the primary concern here is not a NullPointerException but the potential for a DoS vulnerability. This could be exploited if the code that clears the property and the code that retrieves it are in different parts of the application or even different applications, allowing an attacker to manipulate the property and potentially cause issues with the system.

Another vulnerability in the code is the information disclosure, as the code explicitly states that "Windows 95" is not supported, potentially giving an attacker information about the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of clearing the system property, consider changing the comparison to a more flexible and safe way. For example, checking the version of Windows being used instead of just the OS name. Also, consider handling cases where the property is null or is not set.

Additionally, consider removing any explicit unsupported OS messages from the code as they can provide extra information to a potential attacker.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  System.clearProperty("os.name");...String os = System.getProperty("os.name");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase("Windows 95")) System.out.println("Not supported");
