VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 47-54, 56-63
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains potential vulnerabilities in the `register_top` module, specifically in the instantiation of the `register_example` modules. The `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter is set to an incorrect value for `Insecure_Device_ID_1`, and it is left to default for `Insecure_Device_ID_2`. This could lead to unintended behavior and security issues.

EXPLANATION:
The `register_example` module uses a default value for the register, which is computed as `2**REGISTER_WIDTH - 2`. However, for `Insecure_Device_ID_1`, the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter is set to `1224`, which is not the correct value for a 32-bit register. This could lead to unintended behavior when the register is reset. Additionally, for `Insecure_Device_ID_2`, the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter is left to default, which means it will use the computed value of `2**REGISTER_WIDTH - 2`. However, this value is not explicitly set in the code, which could lead to confusion and errors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerabilities, we recommend the following:

* For `Insecure_Device_ID_1`, set the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter to the correct value, which is `2**REGISTER_WIDTH - 2` for a 32-bit register. This value can be computed as `4294967294` (2**32 - 2).
* For `Insecure_Device_ID_2`, explicitly set the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter to the correct value, which is also `4294967294`.
