VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This vulnerability is known as "Hardcoded Sensitive Credentials" or "Hardcoded Credentials."

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a properties file from a Java web application. It contains sensitive credentials (username and password) for authenticating with an LDAP server. These credentials are hardcoded directly into the properties file, making them visible to anyone with access to the file. This poses a significant security risk as an attacker can obtain the credentials and use them to access the LDAP server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Use environment variables or secure external configuration files**: Store sensitive credentials in environment variables or secure external configuration files that are not version-controlled.
2. **Implement a password vault or secrets manager**: Utilize a password vault or secrets manager to securely store and manage sensitive credentials.
3. **Use encrypted credentials**: Consider using encrypted credentials or storing them in a HashiCorp's Vault or similar solution.
4. **Use an external authentication service**: Consider delegating authentication to an external service, such as an OAuth provider or an LDAP server, to avoid storing sensitive credentials.
