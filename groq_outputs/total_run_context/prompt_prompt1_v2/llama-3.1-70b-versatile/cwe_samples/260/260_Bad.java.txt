VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Credentials Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability is present because hardcoded credentials (secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password and secretPassword) are being directly assigned to variables within the code. Hardcoding credentials poses a significant security risk because it makes them accessible to anyone who has access to the code. If an attacker obtains access to the code, they can easily obtain the credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Recommendations for fixing this vulnerability include:

1. Environment Variables: Store sensitive credentials as environment variables and reference them in the code. This way, the credentials are not directly stored in the code and are only accessible to those who have access to the environment.
2. Secure Configuration Files: Store sensitive credentials in secure configuration files that are encrypted and have restricted access permissions.
3. Secure Vault: Use a secure vault solution like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive credentials. These solutions provide secure storage and retrieval of sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:

webapp.ldap.username = secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password = secretPassword
