VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
 Hardcoded database credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a hardcoded database connection string with credentials, including the username ('uid=db2admin') and password ('pwd=password'). Hardcoding database credentials makes them easily accessible to anyone who has access to the code. This can be particularly problematic if the code is stored in a public repository or accessed by unauthorized individuals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following approaches:

- Store database credentials separately from the application code, such as in environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secrets management solution.
- Use a secure method for storing and retrieving database credentials, such as encrypted files or a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
- Implement a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT-based authentication, to replace hardcoded credentials.
- Rotate database credentials regularly to minimize the impact of a potential breach.
