VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition attack (TOC-TOU or Time-of-check to time-of-use vulnerability) which could potentially lead to a double-free condition or Crash/Crash data corruption.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the signals used to handle interruptions (SIGHUP, SIGTERM). When the signal handler function 'sh' is executed, the order in which 'global1' and 'global2' are freed is not guaranteed to be synchronized with other parts of the program. This lack of synchronization can result in a double-free condition or data corruption.

In this particular example, when the signal handler function is triggered while the main function is still executing (to be more specific when 'global1' or 'global2' are being accessed), it is possible to hit the critical section (both 'global1' and 'global2' have been freed while their address values in the handlers have not been updated), thus triggering a double-free condition or corruption of global unallocated or allocated variables.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) Perform synchronization using mutexes to ensure that 'global1' and 'global2' are not accessed while they are being freed in the signal handler function.

2) Use 'sigaction' function instead of 'signal' to establish the signal handler because it provides more control over how the signals should be handled (such as suspending code within the critical section) and reduce chances for signals triggering in critical sections and also sigaction lets setting a flag indicating that the handler function be restarted if it is interrupted by signal delivery.

3) Check that each freed pointer is checked for not being null to avoid wild crashes.

4) Immediately store freed pointer in null: after memory is freed, its pointer is immediately set to NULL, which helps to catch any possibility for a crash due to a double-free.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  #include <signal.h>#include <syslog.h>#include <string.h>#include <stdlib.h>
                     void *global1, *global2;char *what;void sh (int dummy) {
                        syslog(LOG_NOTICE,"%s\n",what);free(global2);free(global1);
                           /* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */
                           
                           sleep(10);exit(0);
                     }
                     int main (int argc,char* argv[]) {
                        what=argv[1];global1=strdup(argv[2]);global2=malloc(340);signal(SIGHUP,sh);signal(SIGTERM,sh);
                           /* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */
                           
                           sleep(10);exit(0);
                     }
