VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Use of a freed memory address for logging a string in the presence of an error condition.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains a vulnerability where a pointer to a memory location that has been freed is used for logging a string. The code checks for an error condition and, if true, frees the memory location pointed to by `ptr` and sets `abrt` to 1. Later, if `abrt` is 1, it uses the same `ptr` for logging an error message, despite having freed the memory location earlier. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes when the program attempts to access the freed memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
(1) To fix this vulnerability, you can store the contents of the pointer in a separate variable before freeing the memory and then use this variable for logging.

(2) Alternatively, check if `abrt` is 1 before freeing the memory location and if so, do not free the memory until after logging the error.

Here's a code snippet illustrating how the first recommendation can be implemented:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
if (err) {
    char* errorPtr = ptr; // Store the pointer in a separate variable
    free(ptr);
    abrt = 1;
}
...
if (abrt) {
    logError("operation aborted before commit", errorPtr);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);if (err) {abrt = 1;free(ptr);}...if (abrt) {logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);}
