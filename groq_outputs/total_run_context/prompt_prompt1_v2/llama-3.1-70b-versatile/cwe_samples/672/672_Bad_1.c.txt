VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Whole code snippet
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a double-free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
A double-free vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to free the same memory location twice. This can cause undefined behavior, leading to crashes, data corruption, or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. In this code snippet, the 'free(ptr)' statement is executed twice, once inside the conditional statement and again outside. If 'abrt' is true, the memory location 'ptr' is freed, and then it is freed again regardless of the value of 'abrt'.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend removing the second 'free(ptr)' statement. The correct code should only free the memory location 'ptr' once, inside the conditional statement or in a separate error handling path. This ensures that 'ptr' is only freed when the memory is no longer needed or there is an error. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
