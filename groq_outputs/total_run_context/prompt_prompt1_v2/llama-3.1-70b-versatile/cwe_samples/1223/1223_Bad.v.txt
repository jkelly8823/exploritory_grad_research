VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an incomplete masking of sensitive data. When writing to the Data_out register, the code only masks bit 0 of the Data_in variable, but does not properly handle the case where Data_in contains sensitive information in the other bits.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, when the write signal is asserted and the Write_once_status is low, the code writes the Data_in variable to the Data_out register after masking bit 0. However, this masking only occurs for bit 0 and not for the other bits. As a result, sensitive information in the other bits of Data_in could be exposed when written to Data_out.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should proper mask all sensitive bits of the Data_in variable before writing it to the Data_out register. This can be achieved by using a proper mask that covers all sensitive bits. For example, if only the upper 15 bits of Data_in contain sensitive information, the code should use a mask that sets those bits to 0.

```verilog
Data_out <= Data_in & 16'hFFFF; 
```

However, the exact mask used depends on the nature of the sensitive data and its location within the Data_in variable.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```verilog
module register_write_once_example
(
  input [15:0] Data_in,
  input Clk,
  input ip_resetn,
  input global_resetn,
  input write,
  output reg [15:0] Data_out
);

reg Write_once_status;

always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip_resetn)
if (~ip_resetn)

  begin
    Data_out <= 16'h0000; 
    Write_once_status <= 1'b0;
  
  end

else if (write & ~Write_once_status) 

  begin
    Data_out <= Data_in & 16'hFFFE; // Input data written to register after masking bit 0
    Write_once_status <= 1'b1; // Write once status set after first write.
  
  end

else if (~write)

  begin
    Data_out[15:1] <= Data_out[15:1];
    Data_out[0] <= Write_once_status;
  
  end
  
endmodule
