VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No potential vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be part of a RISC-V implementation, checking for access control and debug mode. It raises an exception with the cause `ILLEGAL_INSTR` in two specific scenarios:
- When the current privilege level is not the same as the one encoded in `csr_addr.csr_decode.priv_lvl` for a given CSR address, unless that address is `CSR_MEPC`.
- When attempting to access debug mode only CSRs (`csr_addr_i[11:4] == 8'h7b`) while debug mode is not enabled (`!debug_mode_q`).
The exception handling appears to be standard practice, and there are no obvious vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:


if (csr_we || csr_read) begin
							
								if ((riscv::priv_lvl_t'(priv_lvl_o & csr_addr.csr_decode.priv_lvl) != csr_addr.csr_decode.priv_lvl) && !(csr_addr.address==riscv::CSR_MEPC)) begin
								
									csr_exception_o.cause = riscv::ILLEGAL_INSTR;
									csr_exception_o.valid = 1'b1;
								
								end
								// check access to debug mode only CSRs
								if (csr_addr_i[11:4] == 8'h7b && !debug_mode_q) begin
								
									csr_exception_o.cause = riscv::ILLEGAL_INSTR;
									csr_exception_o.valid = 1'b1;
								
								end
