VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to resource clobbering due to a local variable with the same name being declared twice, which may potentially hide the external variable. Additionally, it is vulnerable to a potential NullPointerException (NPE) since there is no check on whether 'products' and 'MAX_PRODUCTS' are properly initialized.

EXPLANATION:
In the `displayProductSummary` method, the variable `productSummary` is redeclared within the `try` block. The return statement will try to return the `productSummary` variable from the outer scope, which has been initialized to an empty string and never reassigned. Therefore, it will return an empty string instead of the actual product summary, potentially clobbering the desired resource. 
Moreover, since 'products' and 'MAX_PRODUCTS' are not checked for initialization, it might result in an NPE if these are null or not properly declared elsewhere in the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the re-declaration of the `productSummary` variable within the `try` block in the `displayProductSummary` method. Instead, use the `productSummary` variable from the outer scope.

2. Add a null check for the `products` variable and `MAX_PRODUCTS` constant to prevent a potential NPE.

3. Ensure that 'products' and 'MAX_PRODUCTS' are properly declared and initialized elsewhere in the code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);}
    catch (Exception ex) {...}
    return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = "";
    if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX_PRODUCTS)) {productSummary = products[index];}else {System.err.println("index is out of bounds");throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();}
    return productSummary;
}
