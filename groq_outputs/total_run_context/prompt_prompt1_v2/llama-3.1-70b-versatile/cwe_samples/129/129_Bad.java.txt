VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `getValue` method does not check if the provided `index` is within the valid bounds of the `array` before attempting to access it.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents a method that returns a value from an array at a specific index. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the provided index. This makes the method vulnerable to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which could occur if an index is passed that is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the array.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a bounds check should be added to ensure that the provided index is within the valid range for the array. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the array before attempting to access it. 

```java
public String getValue(int index) {
    if (index < 0 || index >= array.length) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index " + index + " is out of range");
    }
    return array[index];
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public String getValue(int index) {return array[index];}
```
