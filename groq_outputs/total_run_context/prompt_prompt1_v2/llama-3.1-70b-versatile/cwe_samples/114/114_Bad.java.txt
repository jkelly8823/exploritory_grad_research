VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Arbitrary library loading vulnerability due to the use of System.loadLibrary() to load a dynamic link library.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a significant vulnerability: it loads a dynamic link library ('library.dll') using System.loadLibrary(). This function call can introduce security risks if the library is not properly validated, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious DLL with the same name as the expected library and place it in the system's library search path, causing the application to load and execute the malicious code. This can result in serious security breaches, including data theft, escalation of privileges, and control of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Validate library paths and names**: Ensure that the library name and path used in the System.loadLibrary() call are properly validated to prevent an attacker from manipulating the library loading process.
2. **Use class loader instead of System.loadLibrary()**: Try to use a class loader (such as URLClassLoader) instead of System.loadLibrary() to load the library. This allows for better control over the library loading process and can help prevent arbitrary code execution.
3. **Use a secure library search path**: Configure the application to only search for libraries in secure locations, such as directories that are not writable by untrusted users.
4. **Implement canary values or version numbers**: Include canary values or version numbers in the library to prevent attacks that involve an attacker crafting a malicious library.

ORIGINAL CODE:
System.loadLibrary("library.dll");
