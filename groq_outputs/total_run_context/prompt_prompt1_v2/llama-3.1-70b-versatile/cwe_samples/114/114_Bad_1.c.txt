VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to Dynamic Link Library (DLL) hijacking.
 
EXPLANATION:
The function LoadLibrary is used to load a dynamic link library into the address space of the calling process. However, it is vulnerable to DLL hijacking attacks because it loads libraries from the current working directory first, before checking system directories. An attacker could place a malicious library with the same name in the current working directory, allowing them to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Recommendations for fixing this vulnerability include:
1. Use the full path to the library when calling LoadLibrary, rather than relying on the default search path. This can prevent the library from being loaded from the current working directory.
2. Use the SafeDllSearchMode policy in Windows to restrict the loading of libraries to the application folder, system directories, and the Windows directory.
 
ORIGINAL CODE:
                  LoadLibrary("liberty.dll");
