VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains a function named readFile that attempts to check if the current user has permission to access a given file. However, there is a critical vulnerability in this code that allows an attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory. 

On line 4, the code checks if the given filename is a symbolic link and, if so, resolves it to its actual file path using the readlink function. However, it does not perform any additional checks on this resolved path to ensure it does not point to a sensitive file outside of the intended directory. Furthermore, on line 5, it checks if the file owner of the real file matches the current user. If it does, it outputs the contents of the file without any sanitization or filtering, potentially exposing sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper path normalization and sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be done by using realpath() to normalize the path and then checking if it is within the intended directory.
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific files or directories to be accessed.
3. Implement proper access control checks instead of relying solely on file ownership.
4. Sanitize and filter the output of the file contents to prevent potential XSS or other security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();$realFile = $filename;
	   
    //resolve file if its a symbolic link
    if(is_link($filename)){$realFile = readlink($filename);}
    if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));}
}
```
