VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential memory corruption and arbitrary file write vulnerability due to a vulnerable use of `tmpnam_r()` and `fopen()`.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `tmpnam_r()` to generate a temporary filename. However, `tmpnam_r()` does not guarantee the security of the generated filename. An attacker could potentially predict the generated filename and write to it. Furthermore, when opening the file using `fopen()`, the 'wb+' flag allows both reading and writing. Since the code then writes data received from a socket (line 4) to this file using `fwrite()`, this allows an attacker to write arbitrary data to the file. If an attacker has write access to the directory, they may be able to predict the filename generated by `tmpnam_r()` and write to it before the code does. Additionally, if an attacker can control the data sent from the socket, they may be able to inject data to the file, potentially causing memory corruption or other vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following steps:

- Instead of using `tmpnam_r()`, use a more secure method to generate a temporary filename, such as `mkstemp()` (which is POSIX-only) or `CreateTemporaryFile()` in Windows. These functions create the file immediately and minimize the window of vulnerability.
- Use flags that restrict access to the file. Instead of using 'wb+', use 'wb' to allow only writing. This will prevent the attacker from reading the file while it's being written.
- Validate and sanitize the data received from the socket before writing it to the file to prevent potential memory corruption.
- Use a secure method to handle errors, such as checking the return value of `fopen()` and `fwrite()`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (tmpnam_r(filename)) {
    FILE* tmp = fopen(filename,"wb+");
    while((recv(sock,recvbuf,DATA_SIZE, 0) > 0)&(amt!=0)) 
        amt = fwrite(recvbuf,1,DATA_SIZE,tmp);
}
```
