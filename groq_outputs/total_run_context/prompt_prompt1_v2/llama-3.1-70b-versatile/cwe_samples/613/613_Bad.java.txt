VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A possible infinite session timeout vulnerability is present.

EXPLANATION:
The session-config element in the provided web.xml snippet is set to have a session-timeout of -1. This means that the user's session will not timeout until the web application is restarted or a memory error occurs. This can be used to maintain access to the session, potentially indefinitely. 

While the timeout value is often used as a security mechanism to protect against session fixation or hijacking, an infinite timeout does introduce potential security risks. An attacker could exploit this if they gained access to the session. For instance, an attacker can set malicious session attributes and maintain control over them indefinitely, leading to possible privilege escalation or denial-of-service attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
A reasonable session timeout value should be chosen based on the application's required functionality. Sessions could also be manually invalidated after a certain period if needed. Setting a more secure session timeout is recommended, e.g., something as small as 15 to 30 minutes depending on the application and its typical usage.

ORIGINAL CODE:
             <web-app>
                        [...snipped...]
                           <session-config><session-timeout>-1</session-timeout></session-config>
                     </web-app>
