VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No apparent vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This snippet appears to be written in Verilog, a hardware description language. It's part of a state machine, and the code checks whether two hash values match. If they do, the `pass_check` signal is set high and the state transitions to `Idle`. If they don't, `pass_check` is set low, and in the case where `hashValid` is low, the state remains in `PassChkValid`. 
The snippet does not introduce any apparent vulnerabilities that could lead to potential security risks, assuming that the hash functions used produce secure hash values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
			...
			PassChkValid: begin
				if(hashValid) begin
					if(exp_hash == pass_hash) begin
						pass_check = 1'b1;
						end else begin
						pass_check = 1'b0;
						end
						state_d = Idle;
						
					end else begin
						state_d = PassChkValid;
					end
				end
