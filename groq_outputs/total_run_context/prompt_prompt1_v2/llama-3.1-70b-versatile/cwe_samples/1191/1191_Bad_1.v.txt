VULNERABLE: NO

VULNERABLE_LINES: None

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not find any potential security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be written in a hardware description language, likely Verilog, and is manipulating data using logical operations. While the snippet is incomplete, there are no obvious vulnerabilities in the provided lines.

In particular, the code checks a mode variable (`pass_mode`) before assigning data to `pass_data`, and does not appear to use any user-supplied data without validation. The data manipulation operations are also fixed and do not involve any potential exploitable conditions.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
logic [31-1:0] data_d, data_q;
...
logic [512-1:0] pass_data;
...
Write: begin
    ...
    if (pass_mode) begin
        pass_data = { {60{8'h00}}, data_d};
        state_d = PassChk;
        pass_mode = 1'b0;
    ...
end
