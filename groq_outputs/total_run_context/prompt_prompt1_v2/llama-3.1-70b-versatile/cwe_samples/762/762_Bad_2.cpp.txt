VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Double free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: 
A double free vulnerability occurs when the same block of memory is freed twice. In the provided code snippet, this occurs when the 'delete[] p;' statement is executed regardless of whether 'p' points to a local array or a dynamically allocated array. If 'heap' is 'false', 'p' points to 'localArray', which is a local array and not dynamically allocated. Attempting to delete this array will result in undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
The fix for this vulnerability is to ensure that 'delete[] p;' is only executed when 'p' actually points to a dynamically allocated array. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check the value of 'heap' before deleting 'p'.

```c
class A{
    void foo(bool);
};
void A::foo(bool heap) {
    int localArray[2] = {11, 22};
    int *p = localArray;
    if (heap){
        p = new int[2];
    }
    if (heap) { // Check if p points to a dynamically allocated array
        delete[] p;
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
class A{void foo(bool);};void A::foo(bool heap) {int localArray[2] = {11,22};int *p = localArray;if (heap){p = new int[2];}delete[] p;}
```
