VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential memory corruption through mixing of C and C++ memory management.

EXPLANATION:
The issue lies in the use of `new` from C++, which initializes objects and calls constructors, followed by `free` from C, which does not call destructors and release any resources that might be held by the object. This can result in undefined behavior, such as releasing system resources multiple times or skipping the release of the object's resources.

When you use `new` to initialize an object, it not only allocates memory, but also calls the object's constructor to initialize the object. However, when you use `free` to deallocate that memory, it doesn't call the destructor for that object. This can cause issues if the destructor was responsible for releasing resources held by the object.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, you should use the corresponding C++ memory management function, `delete`, instead of `free`. This will ensure that the object's destructor is called, releasing any resources it was holding.

Here's how you can modify your code:
```
void foo() {
    BarObj* ptr = new BarObj();
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    delete ptr;
}
```
If your intention is to write C and not C++, then use C allocation functions consistently:
```
void foo() {
    BarObj* ptr = malloc(sizeof(BarObj));
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    free(ptr);
}
```
In this case, remember to manually call any necessary initialization and cleanup functions for the object.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
       /* do some work with ptr here */
       
       ...
       free(ptr);
}
```
