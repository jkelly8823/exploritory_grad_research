VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The form names are duplicated within the same formset, which can cause ambiguous form submissions and security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, two forms have the same name attribute ("ProjectForm") within the same formset. This can lead to unpredictable behavior when the forms are submitted, as the browser may send data from both forms with the same name, potentially causing data corruption or security vulnerabilities, such as unintended privilege escalation or data modification. Additionally, having multiple forms with the same name can lead to issues with JavaScript code that relies on the uniqueness of form names.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to ensure that each form within the formset has a unique name attribute. This can be achieved by renaming one or both of the forms to have distinct names. For example:

ORIGINAL CODE:
				   
				   <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
				 
Alternatively, consider using a different attribute, such as the id attribute, to identify the forms, as the id attribute is intended to be unique within a document.

```html
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form id="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
    <form id="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```
