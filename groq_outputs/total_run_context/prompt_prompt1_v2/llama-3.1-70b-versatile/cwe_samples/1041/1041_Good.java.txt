VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code provided performs mathematical calculations and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It does not handle user input, perform file I/O, or interact with external systems, which are common sources of security vulnerabilities. The calculations are purely arithmetic and do not pose a risk.
However, it is worth noting that the code snippet contains redundant calculations in the main method. The ComplexMath function is called twice with the same parameters if r is greater than 1.0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider merging the two conditional statements and calling the ComplexMath function only once to avoid redundant calculations.
```python
if(r > 1.0) {
   surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
}
```
This is not a security vulnerability but rather a performance and maintainability issue.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class Main {
   private double ComplexMath(double r, double s) {
      //complex math equations
      double pi = Math.PI;
      double surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
      return surface_area;
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      double s = 10.0;
      double r = 1.0;
      double surface_area;
      if(r > 0.0) {
         surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
      }
      if(r > 1.0) {
         surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
      }
   }
}
```
