VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly takes user input from the request parameter "email" and outputs it to the HTML page without proper sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the "email" parameter, which would then be executed on the client side when the page is rendered. This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to encode user input before displaying it on the HTML page. One way to do this is by using the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL) `c:out` tag, which automatically escapes HTML characters. Alternatively, you can use the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml` method from the Apache Commons Lang library to manually encode the input.

Here's an example of how you could use the `c:out` tag to sanitize the user input:

```java
<c:out value="${email}"/>
```

If you don't have access to JSTL tags, you can manually encode the input as follows:

```java
String email = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(request.getParameter("email"));
...Email Address: <%= email %>
```

Remember to include the necessary import statements for the Apache Commons Lang library if you choose to use manual encoding.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<% String email = request.getParameter("email"); %>...Email Address: <%= email %>
