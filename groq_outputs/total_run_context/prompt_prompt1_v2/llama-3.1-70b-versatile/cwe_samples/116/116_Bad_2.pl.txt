VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system function call, potentially leading to system compromise.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises in the "doit" subroutine, specifically at the line where the system function is called. The variable $uname is used as part of the command string passed to the system function, without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the input to the GetUntrustedInput function. Although the encode function appears to attempt to prevent some types of attacks by escaping certain special characters, it is not sufficient to prevent exploitation in this context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use safer alternatives to the system function, such as Perl's built-in functions for working with files and directories. If the system function must be used, the command string should be properly sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks. Additionally, the encode function should not be relied upon as the sole means of protecting against attacks, as it does not provide sufficient protection in this context. It is also recommended to validate the input from GetUntrustedInput function to ensure it does not contain malicious characters or patterns.

ORIGINAL CODE:

sub GetUntrustedInput {return($ARGV[0]);}
sub encode {my($str) = @_;$str =~ s/\&/\&amp;/gs;$str =~ s/\"/\&quot;/gs;$str =~ s/\'/\&apos;/gs;$str =~ s/\</\&lt;/gs;$str =~ s/\>/\&gt;/gs;return($str);}
sub doit {my $uname = encode(GetUntrustedInput("username"));print "<b>Welcome, $uname!</b><p>\n";system("cd /home/$uname; /bin/ls -l");}
