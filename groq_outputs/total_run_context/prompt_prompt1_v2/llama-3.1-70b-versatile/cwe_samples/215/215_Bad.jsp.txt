VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Leak Through Sensitive Data Exposure

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet reveals a potential vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically a user's account number, is printed directly to the output when the "debugEnabled" flag is set to true. This is a typical example of sensitive data exposure, where the code is printing out sensitive user data without adequate security checks or consideration for the associated risks.

The issue arises from the fact that in the event an attacker is able to gain knowledge of when the "debugEnabled" flag is active, they can potentially harvest the sensitive account numbers, compromising user data confidentiality.

Furthermore, it's also worth noting that directly printing sensitive data into the response could, in certain contexts, facilitate certain types of attack vectors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this potential vulnerability, we recommend that sensitive data handling is treated with the utmost care and control when displayed or processed in production environments. Below are recommendations that should be implemented:
- Avoid printing sensitive data such as the account number for debugging purposes.
- Consider implementing access controls or masking of sensitive user data.
- Refactor the code so that logging of such sensitive user data happens on the server side and is not included in the output sent to the client.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
                        %>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
