VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The provided PHP code contains hardcoded database credentials, including a database name and password. Hardcoding sensitive data directly into the code can pose a significant security risk. If the code is exposed or accessed by an unauthorized party, the hardcoded credentials could be used to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive data, such as database credentials. This approach helps to keep the sensitive information separate from the code and reduces the risk of exposure.

Here is an example of using environment variables:

```php
$dbName = $_ENV['DB_NAME'];
$dbPassword = $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD'];
```

You can set the environment variables in your operating system or in your PHP configuration file (e.g., `.env` or `php.ini`).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
```
