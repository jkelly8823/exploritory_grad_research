VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection and Potential Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Database Authentication.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the insecure usage of user input ($username, $password) in database authentication without any form of input sanitization or validation. The authentication code seems to be passing these inputs directly to the database without any checks. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, gaining unauthorized access to the database, modifying sensitive data, or escalating privileges. Additionally, if the authentication mechanism relies solely on this function, it may be vulnerable to authentication bypass attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. 
   Update the `$db.authenticateUser($username, $password)` function to accept parameters securely.

2. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `$username` and `$password` variables to ensure they adhere to expected formats and do not contain malicious data.

3. Introduce security measures such as LIMIT 1 in your SQL query to prevent multiple rows being returned in case of injection. Use a library that provides secure authentication mechanisms.

   Consider replacing this simple authentication mechanism with a more robust one, such as PHP's PDO with prepared statements.

4. Ensure that error handling is in place to prevent information disclosure about the database and the authentication mechanism.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
include('database.inc');
$db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword);
$db.authenticateUser($username, $password);?>
