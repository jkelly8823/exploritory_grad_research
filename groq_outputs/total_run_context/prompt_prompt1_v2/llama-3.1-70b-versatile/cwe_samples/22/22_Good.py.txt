VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to potentially read any file on the system.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code uses a filename provided by the user directly in the `open` function. The `os.path.normpath` function is used to normalize the path, but it does not ensure that the resulting path is within a specific directory. This allows an attacker to potentially access any file on the system by providing a path that includes a sequence of `../` or other special characters. For example, if the user provides the filename `/../../../../etc/passwd`, the code will attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure way of handling file paths. One way to do this is to use the `os.path.abspath` function to get the absolute path of the file, and then check if the resulting path is within a specific directory. Additionally, consider using a whitelist of allowed files or directories to further restrict access. The code could also use `os.path.join` to safely join the directory and filename.

Here is an example of how the code could be fixed:

```python
filename = sys.argv[1]
base_dir = '/path/to/allowed/directory'
allowed_files = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']

path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base_dir, filename))

if os.path.commonpath([path]) != base_dir or os.path.basename(path) not in allowed_files:
    print("Error - access denied")
else:
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")

ORIGINAL CODE:

import os
import sys
def main():

    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.normpath(f"{os.getcwd()}{os.sep}{filename}")
    try:

        with open(path, 'r') as f:

            file_data = f.read()


    except FileNotFoundError as e:

        print("Error - file not found")


main()
```
