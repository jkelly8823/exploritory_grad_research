VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and Directory Path Injection Vulnerability
 EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in the lines where the filename is extracted from the HTTP header and then used to output the file to a local upload directory. The filename is obtained using `pLine.lastIndexOf("\\")` which could lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could potentially manipulate the filename to traverse beyond the intended upload directory, potentially allowing them to write to sensitive areas of the file system.

Furthermore, the upload location is created by concatenating a constant directory string with the filename. This is vulnerable to directory path injection, which could allow an attacker to write to arbitrary locations within the file system.

Another concern is the use of `FileWriter` with the `true` parameter, which means that the file will be appended to if it already exists. This could lead to unintended behavior or data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the filename before using it to prevent path traversal and directory path injection attacks. Consider using a library such as Apache Commons IO to handle file operations safely.
2. Use a secure approach to generate unique filenames for uploaded files, such as using a UUID or a random string. This will prevent an attacker from exploiting the `true` parameter in the `FileWriter` constructor.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handling multipart/form-data uploads, such as using Java's built-in `MultipartConfig` annotation or a library like Apache Commons FileUpload.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
    ...
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        ...
        String pLine = new String();String uploadLocation = new String(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING); //Constant value
        // verify that content type is multipart form data
        if (contentType != null && contentType.indexOf("multipart/form-data") != -1) {
            // extract the filename from the Http header
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getInputStream()));...pLine = br.readLine();String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));...
            // output the file to the local upload directory
            try {
                BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));for (String line; (line=br.readLine())!=null; ) {if (line.indexOf(boundary) == -1) {bw.write(line);bw.newLine();bw.flush();}} //end of for loopbw.close();
                // ...
            } catch (IOException ex) {...}
        }
        // ...
    }
    ...
