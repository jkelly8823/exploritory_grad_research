VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability and File Inclusion Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal and File Inclusion vulnerability. On line 3, user input from `param("user")` is concatenated with a root path to form `$profilePath`. If an attacker inserts malicious input, such as `../../../../etc/passwd`, it may be possible for them to access sensitive data. Additionally, on line 5, the contents of `$profilePath` are directly read and printed to the output, allowing the potential inclusion of malicious files or arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input to prevent path traversal attacks. Use a whitelist approach to ensure only allowed characters are present in the input.
2. Use a secure way to handle file paths and file inclusion, such as using a mapping of user IDs to profile files or accessing files through an abstract interface.
3. Implement proper error handling to prevent potential denial of service attacks.
4. Consider escaping or encoding the contents of the file before printing it to the output, to prevent XSS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  my $dataPath = "/users/cwe/profiles";my $username = param("user");my $profilePath = $dataPath . "/" . $username;
                     open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");print "<ul>\n";while (<$fh>) {print "<li>$_</li>\n";}print "</ul>\n";
