VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. It allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system as long as the file name starts with the current working directory. The vulnerability arises from the use of the `sys.argv[1]` which is directly joined with the current working directory to form the file path. An attacker could potentially provide a filename that uses directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access sensitive files outside of the current directory.

Additionally, no validation is performed on the user-provided input (filename) before being used to open a file, which further exacerbates the issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input filename to ensure it does not contain directory traversal sequences. 
2. Use a safer method of opening files, such as using `os.path.abspath()` to normalize the path, and then check if the resulting path is within the expected directory.
3. Consider using a library that provides a safer way of opening files, such as `pathlib`.

Example of the safer way to open files:
```python
import os
import sys
def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    expected_dir = os.getcwd()
    path = os.path.join(expected_dir, filename)
    abs_path = os.path.abspath(path)
    if not abs_path.startswith(expected_dir):
       print("Error - invalid filename")
       return
    try:
        with open(abs_path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")
main()
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
import os
import sys
def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")
main()
```
