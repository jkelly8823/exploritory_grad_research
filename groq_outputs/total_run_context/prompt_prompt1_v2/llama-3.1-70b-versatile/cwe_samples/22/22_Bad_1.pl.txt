VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability due to improper input validation and sanitization. The code is allowing an untrusted input to influence the path of a file to be read, potentially leading to unintended file access.

EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `$Username` variable, which is obtained from an untrusted source (`GetUntrustedInput()`), is used to construct a file path without proper sanitization. Although the code attempts to remove the parent directory (`..`) by using `$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;`, this is insufficient as it does not account for other potential malicious patterns (e.g., `/./`, `/.././`, non-printable characters, etc.). This allows an attacker to bypass the filter and potentially traverse the file system to reach sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should implement proper input validation and sanitization. Consider the following recommendations:

1. Validate the input using a whitelist approach: Only allow a specific set of characters, e.g., alphanumeric, underscore, or hyphen.

2. Implement a more robust sanitization mechanism: Use a library or function that can properly sanitize the input and prevent path traversal attacks, such as `Path::Canonicalize` or a similar solution.

3. Consider using a safer approach: Instead of dynamically constructing file paths using user input, consider using a safer approach, such as using a lookup table or a mapping mechanism to resolve file names.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
