VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect allocation size.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the allocation of the `buf` array. The size of the array is calculated as `pre_len - msg_len`, where `pre_len` is the length of the string "preamble: " and `msg_len` is the length of the message passed to the function. However, if the value of `msg_len` is greater than or equal to `pre_len`, the allocation size becomes zero or negative, which is invalid and can lead to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, the function call `proc_msg ("s",  jnklen)` violates the assumption that the input message starts with the string "preamble: ". This can result in `msg_len` being too small and `pre_len` being larger, also leading to a negative allocation size.

The code tries to address this issue by assuming all strings have a preamble with space, but it does not validate this assumption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input message to ensure it meets the expected format before proceeding with processing.
2. Use dynamically allocated memory instead of fixed-size arrays to avoid buffer overflows. The allocation size should be calculated based on the actual length of the input message and the expected preamble length.
3. Use safer functions for string manipulation, such as `snprintf` or `strcpy_s`, to prevent buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len)
{
    int pre_len = sizeof("preamble: ");
    char buf[pre_len - msg_len];
    ... Do processing here if we get this far
}
char *s = "preamble: message\n";
char *sl = strchr(s, ':');        // Number of characters up to ':' (not including space)
int jnklen = sl == NULL ? 0 : sl - s;    // If undefined pointer, use zero length
int ret_val = proc_msg ("s",  jnklen);    // Violate assumption of preamble length, end up with negative value, blow out stack
```
