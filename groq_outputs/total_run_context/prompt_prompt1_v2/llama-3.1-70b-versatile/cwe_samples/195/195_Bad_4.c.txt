VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking.

EXPLANATION:
The function `returnChunkSize(void *)` is returning the size of the chunk, which is then used in the `memcpy` function without proper bounds checking. By subtracting 1 from the returned size, the code is attempting to prevent buffer overflows, but this approach is still vulnerable to integer underflow. If the returned size is 0, the `memcpy` function will attempt to copy a large amount of data, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

Furthermore, the returned size is not validated to check if it's a valid size for the given buffer. If the returned size is larger than the actual size of the buffer, a buffer overflow will occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, proper bounds checking should be added to validate the returned size. The code should check that the size is a valid size for the given buffer and handle any potential errors that may occur. The function `returnChunkSize(void *)` should also be reviewed to ensure it's returning a valid and safe size.

Here are some possible fixes:

* Add error checking for the returned size:
```c
size_t chunkSize = returnChunkSize(destBuf);
if (chunkSize == 0 || chunkSize > sizeof(destBuf)) {
    // Handle error
} else {
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, chunkSize);
}
```
* Use `std::copy` or `std::move` instead of `memcpy` to prevent buffer overflows:
```c
std::copy(srcBuf, srcBuf + chunkSize, destBuf);
```
* Review the `returnChunkSize(void *)` function to ensure it's returning a valid and safe size.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  int returnChunkSize(void *) {
                        
                           
                           /* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
                           
                           
                           * else, return -1 to indicate an error
                           
                           
                           */
                           ...
                     }int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
