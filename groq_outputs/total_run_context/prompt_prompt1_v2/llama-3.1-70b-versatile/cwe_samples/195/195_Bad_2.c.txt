VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability through Unbounded Memory Allocation

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code allocates memory for `numHeaders` number of `PacketHeader` structures without validating the value of `numHeaders` before the allocation. Although there is a check to ensure that `numHeaders` is not greater than 100, this validation is not sufficient as it allows `numHeaders` to reach a value of 100, potentially leading to an allocation of a large amount of memory. This can lead to a denial of service attack by exhausting the system's memory resources or potentially crashing the system.

Furthermore, there is no validation of whether the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails (i.e., `malloc` returns `NULL`), the code does not check for this, which can lead to segmentation faults or crashes when trying to access the allocated memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase the validation range for `numHeaders` to prevent potential large memory allocations. Consider using a more reasonable maximum value based on your application's specific requirements.
2. Validate the result of the `malloc` call to prevent potential segmentation faults or crashes.
3. Consider using a safer memory allocation function, such as `calloc` or `realloc`, to handle these scenarios.
4. Implement additional error handling and checks to handle the case where the allocation fails.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  DataPacket *packet;int numHeaders;PacketHeader *headers;
                     sock=AcceptSocketConnection();ReadPacket(packet, sock);numHeaders =packet->headers;
                     if (numHeaders > 100) {ExitError("too many headers!");}headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader);ParsePacketHeaders(packet, headers);
