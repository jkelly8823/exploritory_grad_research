VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function `readdata()` returns an unsigned integer but contains code paths where it can return a negative value.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a function `readdata()` with a return type of `unsigned int`. However, within the function, there is a code path where the variable `amount` is assigned the value `-1` when `result` is equal to `ERROR`. This can lead to a situation where the function returns an incorrect value.

In C and C++, unsigned integers are not capable of representing negative numbers. When a negative number is assigned to an unsigned integer, it will be converted to its corresponding positive value, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The return type of the function `readdata()` should be changed to a signed integer type, such as `int` or `strtolower_perror_t`, to accommodate the possibility of returning negative values. Additionally, the code path where `amount` is assigned the value `-1` should be reviewed to determine if it is the desired behavior.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  unsigned int readdata () {int amount = 0;...if (result == ERROR)amount = -1;...return amount;}
