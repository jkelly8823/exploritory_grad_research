VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded sensitive data using a property that is also printed to the error stream in case of absence.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided uses the `System.getProperty` method to retrieve the keystore password. This method is typically used to retrieve properties set using the `-D` flag on the command line. However, this method does not handle sensitive data securely. 
Moreover, when the property is not available (i.e., `keystorePass == null`), the application throws an error message which still provides context that the keystore password is missing. 
However, more disturbingly, while the password itself might not be exposed, the error does indicate that there exists a keystore password for some domain, which could slightly reduce an attacker's search space for a domain with an exposed keystore password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To handle sensitive data securely, use a secure property management mechanism. This could involve using environment variables, encrypted configuration files, or secure property management libraries.
When handling errors related to sensitive data, avoid printing error messages that provide context about the data. Instead, provide a generic error message that does not reveal any sensitive information.
Consider using a secure mechanism for specifying the keystore password, such as a secure environment variable or a trusted configuration file.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String keystorePass = System.getProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword");if (keystorePass == null) {System.err.println("ERROR: Keystore password not specified.");System.exit(-1);}
