VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (multiple lines imply vulnerability but a single line causes issue) lines 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The class UserAccount has public access to the class members (implied but public keyword used). The username and password are stored as plain-text in the class. However, the password being stored in plain text is the vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
While this code does not specifically set or retrieve user passwords, its design implies that passwords are stored in plain text. Plain text password storage allows an attacker who gains read-only access to the stored passwords to see the actual passwords.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, passwords should be stored securely using a salted hash function. When a user creates or updates their password, the password should be hashed, and the hash should be stored instead of the password. This allows for comparing the hashed version of the input password with the stored version. Recommended hash functions for password storage include PBKDF2, Bcrypt, and Argon2. 
      Specifically: hash the passwords on storage and comparison to prevent the use from revealing the actual password to a malicious user.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
class UserAccount{public:...
               private:char username[MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH+1];char password[MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH+1];};
```
