VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 13, 21
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dangling pointer and potential null pointer dereference.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in three instances in the given code snippet. 

1. When the code increments the 'str' pointer without checking for a null character in lines 13-15. To determine when to stop iterating, the code checks for '*str == NULL', which will always return false because a null character in a string is '\0', which is equivalent to 0 in C when compared to an integer but will not be equal to NULL.

2. The condition '*str != NULL' in line 7 is incorrect. It will continue iterating the loop until *str == NULL. Since NULL in C is defined as (void*)0, it will always have a false condition. This will potentially lead to an out-of-bounds access when str does not contain NULL.

3. The function 'malloc' allocates memory for a null-terminated string of maximum length 19 (if including space for the null character), but there is no error checking to see if this is successful. If 'malloc' fails, 'str' will be NULL, and the program will crash when 'strcpy(str, "Search Me!");' tries to access memory through a NULL pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the condition '*str != NULL' with '*str != '\0'' in line 7. This will check for the actual null character, rather than the NULL value.
2. Perform bounds checking after the 'malloc' function call to ensure memory was allocated successfully.
3. Consider using 'strchr' from the string library instead of manually iterating over the string.
4. Ensure that pointer arithmetic operations are done with caution, and pointers are not advanced past the end of allocated memory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)

int contains_char(char c){
    char *str;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, "Search Me!");while( *str != NULL){
          if( *str == c ){
                
                   /* matched char, free string and return success */
                   free(str);return SUCCESS;
             }
             /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
             
             str = str + 1;
       }
       /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
       
       free(str);return FAILURE;
}
