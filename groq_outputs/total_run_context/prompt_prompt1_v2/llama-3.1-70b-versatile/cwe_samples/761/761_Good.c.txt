VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of a dynamically allocated string with a potential buffer overflow vulnerability, and the lack of error checking for memory allocation failures.

EXPLANATION:
The code defines a function `cointains_char` which checks if a character is present in a hardcoded string. The string is dynamically allocated using `malloc`, but there is no error checking to ensure that the memory allocation is successful. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the memory allocation fails.

Furthermore, the code uses `strcpy` to copy the hardcoded string into the dynamically allocated memory. The hardcoded string "Search Me!" is 10 bytes long, but the allocated memory is 20 bytes. While this is not an immediate overflow vulnerability, it does create a buffer overflow vulnerability if the string being copied was larger than the allocated memory.

In addition, the code manually increments the `i` variable using `i = i + 1`. This is not an immediate vulnerability but can make the code more prone to off-by-one errors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error checking for memory allocation failures using the return value of `malloc`.
2. Consider using a safer alternative to `strcpy`, such as `strncpy`, to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
3. Use a more idiomatic way of incrementing the `i` variable, such as `i++`.
4. Consider using a more robust way of handling string operations, such as using a string library that provides safer functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)
int cointains_char(char c){
    char *str;
    int i = 0;
    str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));    
    strcpy(str, "Search Me!");   
    while( i < strlen(str) ){
        if( str[i] == c ){
            /* matched char, free string and return success */
            free(str);
            return SUCCESS;
        }
        /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
        i = i + 1;
    }
    /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
    free(str);
    return FAILURE;
}
