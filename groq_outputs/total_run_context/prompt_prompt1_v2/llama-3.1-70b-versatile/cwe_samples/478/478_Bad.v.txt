VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-21
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet contains an incomplete case statement in the always block, which may lead to unexpected behavior when user_input has a value other than those specified in the case statement. This is a variant of a 'dead code' type vulnerability, which can affect the reliability and correctness of the program.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, the case statement only handles the cases for user_input values 3'h0 to 3'h5. However, since user_input is a 3-bit input, it can have values from 3'h0 to 3'h7. If the user_input has a value other than those specified in the case statement, the 'state' variable will retain its previous value. This can cause unexpected behavior if the user_input has a value of 3'h6 or 3'h7, leading to reliability issues.

Furthermore, the 'dead code' for the case statements 3'h0, 3'h1, 3'h2 is present. This does not affect the functionality but it is unnecessary, making it harder to understand the purpose of the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to add a default case statement to handle values of user_input that are not explicitly specified. This will prevent unexpected behavior when the user_input has a value other than those specified in the case statement. 

Additionally, remove 'dead code' for the case statements 3'h0, 3'h1, 3'h2.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
module fsm_1(out, user_input, clk, rst_n);
  input [2:0] user_input; 
  input clk, rst_n;
  output reg [2:0] out;
  reg [1:0] state;
  always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n )
  begin
    if (!rst_n)
      state = 3'h0;
    else
      case (user_input)
        3'h3:
        3'h4: state = 2'h2;
        3'h5: state = 2'h1;
        default: state = 2'h0;  // default case added for other values
      endcase
  end
  out <= {1'h1, state};
endmodule
```
