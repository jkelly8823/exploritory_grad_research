VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a simple switch-case statement that processes different steps based on a calculated value. The variable 'step' is calculated by adding 'input1' and 'input2'. The calculated value then determines the branch to execute. There does not appear to be any obvious security vulnerabilities in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
let step = input1 + input2;
switch(step) {
case 1:
alert("Process step 1.");
break;
case 2:
alert("Process step 2.");
break;
case 3:
alert("Process step 3.");
break;
default:
alert("Unexpected step encountered.");
}
// program execution continues...
