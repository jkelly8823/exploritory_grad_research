VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Exit due to Unhandled Errors
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability where it exits the program using a negative exit code (-1) without properly handling the error. The code calls an `exit(-1)` function when the `security_check` function fails, which may lead to incomplete cleanup of system resources or sensitive information. Furthermore, the code uses a generic "Unknown error" message when an unexpected result is encountered, potentially revealing internal implementation details.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to handle errors in a more secure and controlled way. Instead of immediately exiting the program, consider using a more structured error handling approach, such as throwing exceptions or returning error codes that can be handled further up the call stack. Additionally, avoid using generic error messages and provide more informative and specific error messages.

It is also worth noting that `security_check` function result value should be narrowed down to only include known and expected values to limit potential unknown states.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
#define FAILED 0
#define PASSED 1
int result;
...result = security_check(data);
switch (result) {
    case FAILED:
    printf("Security check failed!\n");
    exit(-1);
          //Break never reached because of exit()
          break;
       case PASSED:
    printf("Security check passed.\n");
    break;
       default:
    printf("Unknown error (%d), exiting...\n",result);
    exit(-1);
```
In addition to these recommendations, ensure all resources are cleaned up and sensitive information is securely destroyed before the program terminates. This could mean closing file handles, sockets, database connections, or any other system resources that were allocated.
