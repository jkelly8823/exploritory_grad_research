VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a simple JavaScript switch statement that evaluates the value of the `step` variable, which is calculated by adding `input1` and `input2`. The code then displays an alert message based on the value of `step`. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as user input being directly injected into a query or being used to construct a command.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required.

ORIGINAL CODE:
let step = input1 + input2;
switch(step) {
case 1:
alert("Process step 1.");
break;
case 2:
alert("Process step 2.");
break;
case 3:
alert("Process step 3.");
break;
}
