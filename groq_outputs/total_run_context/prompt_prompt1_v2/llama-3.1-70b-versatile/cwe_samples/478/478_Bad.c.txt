VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a simple switch statement used to evaluate the result of a security check. The code correctly checks the result and handles both the FAILED and PASSED cases.

The exit(-1) call in the case of FAILED might be considered questionable, as it immediately terminates the program without any chance to cleanup or recover. However, this cannot be accurately assessed in isolation without more context. Further examination of how this function is used and what happens in the event of a failed security check would be necessary to determine if it is truly a vulnerability.

No other obvious vulnerabilities were found in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define FAILED 0
#define PASSED 1

int result;
... 
result = security_check(data);
switch (result) {
    case FAILED:
        printf("Security check failed!\n");
        exit(-1);
        //Break never reached because of exit()
        break;
    case PASSED:
        printf("Security check passed.\n");
        break;
}
// program execution continues...
...
