VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential vulnerability exists due to the direct assignment of user-provided data to variable names without proper validation or sanitization.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be assigning variable values from client-provided data, specifically the original name of the file, without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities such as path traversal attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the variables are used in a file system or web context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the client-provided file name to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters.
2. Use secure file naming conventions to prevent potential path traversal attacks.
3. Avoid using user-provided input directly in file system operations or web outputs.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$varname = name of the temporary file on local machine
$varname_size = size of file
$varname_name = original name of file provided by client
$varname_type = MIME type of the file
