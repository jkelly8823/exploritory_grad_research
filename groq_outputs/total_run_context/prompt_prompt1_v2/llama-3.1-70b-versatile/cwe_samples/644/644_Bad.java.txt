VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Unvalidated Untrusted Input in HTTP Header Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 
The code adds an HTTP header with a value that is derived from untrusted raw input data. This is vulnerable to HTTP header injection attacks. A malicious user may be able to inject arbitrary headers and manipulate the HTTP response. This could allow malicious actions such as phishing, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cookie injection, depending on the context.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Validate and sanitize the untrusted input data before adding it to the HTTP header. 
2. Do not use untrusted raw input data to construct HTTP headers. Instead, parse and validated the data into parameters that can be safely added to headers.
3. If including untrusted raw input is necessary, safely encode it to prevent header injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
response.addHeader(HEADER_NAME, untrustedRawInputData);
