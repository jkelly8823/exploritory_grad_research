VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbounded Resource Use (in this case, memory aliasing) - The code snippet is attempting to read and write to a memory location (`reglk_mem`) within a 'for' loop. However, there is no validation or checks within the loop to prevent overwriting the memory beyond its intended size.
 
EXPLANATION:
A 'for' loop is being used to clear the `reglk_mem` memory location by iteratively writing 'h0 to each location for a total of 6 iterations. However, there is a risk that `reglk_mem` exceeds the initial allocation size which is not checked in the given code. This could result in attempting to write outside of the allocated memory block.

Although it's most likely there's 'for-ever' loop that gets run from 0-5 which is inside the bounds and also uses the 6 as the for-loop condition, and j<6 prevents out of bounds but if this isn't the case everywhere there's an issue so included the possible error 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
While this appears to be safe within this specific use-case, to validate this will be addressed the following lines have been modified:
 
  1. Rather than assuming the loop condition is always met check if this will still occur elsewhere, so here change the for loop parameters.

```verilog
              for (j=0; j < $size(reglk_mem) && j<6; j=j+1) begin
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


            module reglk_wrapper #(
            ...
            
              always @(posedge clk_i)
              
                begin
                
                  if(~(rst_ni && ~jtag_unlock && ~rst_9))
                  
                    begin
                    
                      for (j=0; j < 6; j=j+1) begin
                      
                        reglk_mem[j] <= 'h0;
                      
                      end
                    
                    end
                  
                  ...
