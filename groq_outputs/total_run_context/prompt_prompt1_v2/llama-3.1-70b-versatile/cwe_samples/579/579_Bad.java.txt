VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. IDOR occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, allowing an attacker to access and manipulate sensitive data.

In this case, the `DataGlob` class contains sensitive attributes (`globName` and `globValue`) that are being stored directly into an HttpSession when calling the `addToSession` method. If an attacker can manipulate the HttpSession, they could access and potentially modify sensitive data.

Furthermore, storing an entire object (`DataGlob`) in a HttpSession can make the application vulnerable to other issues such as session tampering or cookie injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use an appropriate serialization method (JSON, XML, etc.) to encode and store the sensitive data instead of storing direct object references.
2. Verify the authenticity of the object before storing it in the HttpSession.
3. Avoid storing the `DataGlob` object directly into the HttpSession. Instead, store only the necessary information (e.g., a token, an identifier) and retrieve the actual data when needed.
4. Consider using an encryption mechanism to protect sensitive data stored in the HttpSession.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public class DataGlob {
    String globName;String globValue;
    public void addToSession(HttpSession session) {session.setAttribute("glob", this);}
}
```

Please note that it is generally considered a bad practice to store non-serializable objects directly into an HttpSession, even if the security issues mentioned above are not present. These objects might cause other problems like class version conflicts when a load-balanced or cluster-enabled web application is deployed.
