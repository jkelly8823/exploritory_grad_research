Double-Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presented contains a double-free vulnerability. This occurs when the same block of memory is attempted to be freed twice. In this case, the memory allocated by `malloc` is stored in the `ptr` variable. The code attempts to free this memory in two places: once when `abrt` is true, and again outside of the conditional statement. If `abrt` is true, the memory is freed first, and then freed again outside of the conditional statement, resulting in a double-free.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should only attempt to free the memory once. Since the logic of the `abrt` conditional statement is not entirely clear, one of the following approaches can be taken:

1. Shift the second `free(ptr)` call inside an `else` block paired with the `if (abrt)` block. This ensures that the memory is not freed twice.

```
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
} else {
    // Other code...
    free(ptr);
}
```

2. Remove the second `free(ptr)` call outside of the conditional statement, and ensure that the memory is properly freed within the `if (abrt)` block.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
