VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to store user passwords, which is considered insecure for password storage.

EXPLANATION:
The MD5 hashing algorithm is widely considered broken for password storage due to its vulnerability to collisions and preimage attacks. MD5 is also a fast hashing algorithm, which makes brute-force attacks against password hashes computationally feasible. Furthermore, password hashes should be unique and unguessable, even to the system administrators, for security and compliance reasons. However, MD5 produces relatively short (32 characters) and deterministic hashes, making it inadequate for secure password storage.

Additionally, there is no salting, which means that users with the same password will have the same password hash, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a password hashing algorithm designed to be slow and unique to each user, such as bcrypt, argon2, PBKDF2, or scrypt. This would make brute-force attacks more computationally expensive. Also, always use a random salt for each user password.

Improved version of the code:

```python
import bcrypt

def storePassword(userName, password):
    # Generate a random salt for each user
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    
    # Hash the password using bcrypt
    hashedPassword = bcrypt.hashpw(password, salt)
    
    return updateUserLogin(userName, hashedPassword)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()

# UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
```
