VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure password hashing and potential hard-coded salt value.
EXPLANATION:
This code uses hashlib's MD5 hashing algorithm to store user passwords, which is insecure for several reasons. First, MD5 is a fast hashing algorithm that was designed for data integrity, not password storage. Modern password crackers can easily recover the original password from an MD5 hash using a rainbow table or brute force attack. Additionally, a constant salt value "SaltGoesHere" is used, which makes the hashed passwords predictable. A fixed salt value also allows attackers to precompute and store the results of MD5 hashing for common passwords. If the salt value is disclosed in the source code, attackers can use it to precompute and store results for cracking passwords.

Furthermore, the lack of variable declarations and import statements indicate that the code is missing essential components. However, according to our given instructions, we will ignore any such warnings.

Lastly, we see that `updateUserLogin` method is not provided in this code snippet but ideally it should check for potential SQL injection if the hashedPassword is used as is in SQL queries.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a slow hashing algorithm that was designed for password storage, such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt. A suitable salt value should be randomly generated for each user, not reused across multiple users or even multiple password updates for the same user. Python's `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac` function or the `bcrypt` library could be used instead.

Moreover, consider using a well-tested password hashing library (e.g., `bcrypt` or `argparse`) that automates many of the steps and would prevent common errors.

Also, prefer to update `updateUserLogin` to either use an ORM or parametrize values in case when building SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
# UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
```
