VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to an unsalted SHA1 password hash, which allows an attacker to use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) of hashes for common passwords, thus enabling faster brute-force attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the SHA1 hashing algorithm, but there is no indication that an adequate salt value is being used. A salt value is a random, unique string that is added to the password before it's hashed. Without a salt value, the SHA1 hash is static and can be matched more easily by an attacker using precomputed tables. 

However, SHA1 has other issues as well. The SHA1 hashing algorithm is also vulnerable to brute-force attacks, as well as certain types of pre-image attacks.

Furthermore, the password seems to be checked by passing it through the "(secret_password()". Without knowing what this function does, it is hard to truly diagnose, but if this is pulling in a salted password, even then the issue would remain considering it appears SHA1 is being used. This could lead to a scenario where SHA1 output matches are just a start. Then attackers would be able cross reference their compute hashes for those hashed functions.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- migrate to a more secure hashing algorithm, such as PBKDF2, Argon2, or Bcrypt
- Correct the current hashing using simple_digest("sha1", ctext, salt, password)
- replace SHA1 hashing with a more suitable hashing implementation
- validate the hash length check
- equal check does not specify the length that needs to be equals
- To be sure the hash isn't being reversed on an attack
 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {login_user();}
}
```
