VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4, 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a cryptographic hash weakness and insecure comparison.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses SHA as a cryptographic hash function for password storage, but it is outdated and not recommended for security purposes. SHA-1, in particular, is vulnerable to collisions and pre-image attacks.

The code also uses the `MessageDigest` class incorrectly. The `password.digest()` statement should be `encer.digest()`, which suggests a potential variable naming issue.

Furthermore, the comparison of the hash is done using a function called `equal()`, which is not defined in the snippet. If this function is not properly implemented, it could lead to potential security issues. It's recommended to use a secure comparison function, like `MessageDigest.isEqual()`.

Additionally, the code does not seem to handle any potential exceptions that may occur when instantiating the `MessageDigest` class or updating it with the user's input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Recommendations for this code would be to:
- Use a more secure hash function like bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2, as recommended by NIST and OWASP.
- Ensure the correct usage of the `MessageDigest` class.
- Handle potential exceptions when instantiating and using the `MessageDigest` class.
- Use a secure comparison function for hash comparison.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest(); 
//Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {
    login_user();
}
```
