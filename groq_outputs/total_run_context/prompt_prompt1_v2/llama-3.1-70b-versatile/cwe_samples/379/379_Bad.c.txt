VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unproper Error Handling and Potential TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shown contains two vulnerabilities. Firstly, the error handling in case of tmpfile() failure is inadequate. While it checks for an error, it only prints the error message with perror() and then returns -1. This could potentially leak sensitive information, allowing an attacker to gain insight into the system's behavior.

Secondly, there is a potential TOCTOU vulnerability in the removal of the temporary file using rmtmp(). The possibility of file access changing between the time the file is created with tmpfile() and the time it's attempted to be deleted using rmtmp() exists. Attackers might substitute the newly created temp file with the reference of another critical system file. In that case, when rmtmp() removes the temp file, it unknowingly removes a vital system file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of calling perror() for error handling, consider logging the error for auditing purposes and avoid returning error codes that could reveal sensitive information.
- When opening the temporary file with tmpfile(), use the fd parameter and O_EXCL flags to create the file safely to avoid TOCTOU vulnerability.
- After the deletion of the temporary file, verify whether it has been deleted successfully.

Here is an example of how to safely open a file and prevent TOCTOU vulnerability:

```c
FILE *stream;
int fd;

fd = open("path/to/file", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL, 0600);
if (fd < 0) {
    // Log error instead of using perror
    return (-1);
}
stream = fdopen(fd, "w");
// use stream and close
close(fd);

// verify removal success
if(remove("path/to/file") != 0)
    // Log error, the removal of temporary file failed
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
FILE *stream;if( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) {
    // original warning below ( removed to leave original text pristine)
        perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");return (-1);
  }
  // write data to tmp file
  ...// remove tmp file
rm tmp();
  ```
