VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code invokes getHostName() on an InetAddress object, which performs a reverse DNS lookup. This can potentially lead to a Slow DNS Lookup Attack vulnerability if the DNS resolution of the remote IP address is slow or hangs indefinitely.

EXPLANATION:
The `InetAddress.getByName(ip)` method resolves the IP address to a hostname. However, if the DNS resolution is slow or hangs indefinitely, the `getHostName()` method can block the thread indefinitely. This can potentially cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if an attacker intentionally provides a slow or hanging DNS resolution.

Additionally, this can also lead to a situation where the method call stalls, blocking the execution of the servlet and potentially leading to performance degradation or server crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, we can consider the following alternatives:

1. Avoid performing DNS lookups on remote IP addresses. 
   Instead, consider logging or displaying the IP address directly.

2. Use a library that provides asynchronous or cached DNS resolution to prevent blocking the thread.

3. Implement a timeout for DNS lookups to prevent indefinite blocking.

4. Move DNS resolution to a background thread to prevent blocking the main request thread.

In case it is necessary to resolve the IP address to a hostname, consider implementing additional security measures to limit the impact of a potential DoS attack.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
...out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());
}
```

Here's a better way to handle this:

```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
  InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
  String hostName = addr.getHostName();
  log.debug("Request from host '{}'", hostName);
}
out.println("Hello");
}
```
