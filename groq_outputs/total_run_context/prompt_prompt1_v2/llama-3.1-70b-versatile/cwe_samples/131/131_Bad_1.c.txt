VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to a potential integer overflow when calculating the size of the memory allocation.

EXPLANATION: 
The code multiplies the number of images (`num_imgs`) by the size of the struct (`sizeof(img_t)`) when allocating memory for the `table_ptr` array. This calculation can lead to an integer overflow if `num_imgs` is a large value, causing the allocated memory size to wrap around and be smaller than expected. This can result in a buffer overflow when storing data in the `table_ptr` array.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Check for integer overflow when calculating the memory size: Use a safer method to calculate the maximum value that can be multiplied by `sizeof(img_t)` without causing an overflow.
2. Validate the value of `num_imgs`: Ensure that `num_imgs` is a reasonable value and not too large.
3. Use a safer memory allocation function: Consider using a function like `calloc` instead of `malloc`, which initializes the allocated memory to zero and can help prevent issues with buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
... 
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
```
