VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow and does not perform proper error checking on the allocation.

EXPLANATION:
The allocated memory is multiplied by the size of an integer for simplicity; however, this multiplication and typecasting is happening implicitly in this code snippet through "(int*)". A cast with malloc can potentially hide bugs or unexpected system behavior.

Furthermore, input validation for id_sequence[2] is non-existent; if a different variable were used in place of 97531 and the variable is oversized against an attempt to insert the data into id_sequence[2] you could be dealing with a buffer overflow, although an integer will be truncated in c++.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Perform explicit multiplication of the allocation size by the size of the type (int) to prevent a potential type casting bug.

Use a check to verify the allocated memory meets the size requirements.

Consider using calloc, which initializes all bits to zero, to ease in tracking variable errors or improper memory behavior.

Validate and ensure that all data inserted into id_sequence does not exceed the allocated array size to prevent potential buffer overflow.

Ensure you free the allocated memory after use to prevent memory leaks.

Consider checking against system limits by including the 'limits.h' or using a sentinel to track if malloc resulted in a dangling pointer.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int *id_sequence;
                     
                     /* Allocate space for an array of three ids. */
                     
                     
                     id_sequence = (int*) malloc(3);if (id_sequence == NULL) exit(1);
                     
                     /* Populate the id array. */
                     
                     
                     id_sequence[0] = 13579;id_sequence[1] = 24680;id_sequence[2] = 97531;
