VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Inclusion

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it directly uses untrusted user input in the filename. Although the input is filtered to remove '../', this is not sufficient to prevent path traversal. An attacker could use a variation of the '../' sequence, such as '/../', to bypass this filter. Then, they could potentially access and read any file on the system that the running code has permission to access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Recommendations to fix this vulnerability are as follows:

*   Validate untrusted user input: Ensure that user input is validated and follows a predefined format before using it to construct a filename.
*   Use canonicalization: Normalize the filename to its actual path before attempting to read a file, to prevent path traversal attempts.
*   Limit file access: Limit the files and directories that the code has permission to access, to minimize potential damage.
*   Use secure file inclusion: Use functions that securely include files, such as using templates instead of direct file inclusion.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
