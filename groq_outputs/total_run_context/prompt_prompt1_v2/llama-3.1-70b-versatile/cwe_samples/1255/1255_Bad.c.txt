VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-15, 17-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the difference in power consumption when checking the password. This vulnerability arises because the code branches differently based on the correctness of the password, which can be exploited to leak information about the password.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present due to the fact that the code has two distinct paths: one for when the password byte matches the stored byte, and one for when it doesn't. The line `password_ok |= 1;` and `password_ok |= 0;` exhibit different power consumption patterns. An attacker can measure these power consumption differences to deduce information about the correct password. This vulnerability is increased when executing on a microcontroller with limited security features.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be rewritten to maintain constant-time execution, regardless of the password's correctness. One way to achieve this is by introducing a dummy loop that always runs for a fixed amount of time. This will equalize the power consumption and eliminate the timing difference. Additionally, the code could be reviewed to incorporate specific cryptographic features designed to prevent timing attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

           static nonvolatile password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
           do
	   
             while (password_tries == 0) ; // Hang here if no more password tries
             password_ok = 0;
             for (i = 0; i < NUM_PW_DIGITS; i++)
	     
               if (GetPasswordByte() == stored_password([i])
	       
		 password_ok |= 1; // Power consumption is different here
	       
               else
	       
		 password_ok |= 0; // than from here
	       
	     
             end
             if (password_ok > 0)
	     
               password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
               break_to_Ok_to_proceed
	     
             password_tries--;
	   
           while (true)
           // Password OK
