VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a simple Finite State Machine (FSM) implemented in Verilog, a Hardware Description Language (HDL). The FSM seems to be a basic D-Flip Flop. The analysis has checked for common issues such as:

- Unprotected RST pin
- Improper Synchronization
- Use of Unbounded Variables
- Race conditions

No potential vulnerability was found in this code snippet. This analysis result does not guarantee the entire circuit is safe, as the analysis was limited to this tiny code snippet. Given no vulnerability was found, no recommendations can be provided for improvement.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
ORIGINAL CODE:
    
            module siso(clk,rst,a,q);
	    
              input a;
              input clk,rst;
              output q;
              reg q;
              
              always@(posedge clk,posedge rst)
              begin
	      
		if(rst==1'b1)
		
                  q<=1'b0;
		
		else
		
                  q<=a;
