VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a function that locks a mutex using `pthread_mutex_lock`, accesses a shared resource, and then unlocks the mutex using `pthread_mutex_unlock`. This is a basic and proper usage of mutexes to protect shared resources from concurrent access. No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as the code appears to be secure.
ORIGINAL CODE:
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
    
    /* access shared resource */
    
    pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
