VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via input fields without proper sanitization.

EXPLANATION:
The given form inputs do not have any validation or sanitization checks in place to prevent malicious content injection. An attacker could submit a request with injected JavaScript code in the 'firstname', 'lastname', or 'email' fields. This could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack if the injected code is echoed back to users' browsers without proper encoding or filtering. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent XSS attacks, ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized before being processed or displayed. Here are a few steps you can take to address the vulnerability:

- Implement client-side validation using JavaScript, and validate user input on the server-side to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
- Use a template engine to separate presentation logic from application logic, which can help prevent direct echoing of user input in HTML.
- Use HTML encoding on user input before displaying it.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict which sources of content are allowed to be executed within a web page.

Note that due to the provided snippet, I was only able to evaluate the given HTML form. It is recommended to also evaluate any server-side code that handles form submissions for additional vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<form action="/url/profile.php" method="post"><input type="text" name="firstname"/><input type="text" name="lastname"/><br/><input type="text" name="email"/><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Update"/></form>
