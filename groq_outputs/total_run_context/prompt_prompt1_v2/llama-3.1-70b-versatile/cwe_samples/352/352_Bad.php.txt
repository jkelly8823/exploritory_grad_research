VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential SQL injection vulnerability through the use of unsanitized user input (`$_POST['email']`) sent to the database.

EXPLANATION:
The `SendUpdateToDatabase` function is being called with unsanitized user input (`$_POST['email']`). This can potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. Although we don't have visibility into the `SendUpdateToDatabase` function, typical use cases involve direct SQL queries or interaction with the database. If the input is not properly sanitized, this can lead to unauthorized access and data manipulation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following steps should be taken:
- Validate user input: Verify that the input (`$_POST['email']`) conforms to the expected format (e.g., a valid email address).
- Sanitize user input: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent the injection of malicious SQL code. This can be achieved using mechanisms like PDO or MySQLi with prepared statements.
- Implement error handling: Monitor database interactions for potential SQL errors and handle exceptions accordingly.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
// initiate the session in order to validate sessions
session_start();

//if the session is registered to a valid user then allow update

if (! session_is_registered("username")) {

  echo "invalid session detected!";

  // Redirect user to login page
  [...]
  exit;
}

// The user session is valid, so process the request


// and update the information


update_profile();
function update_profile {
  
  // read in the data from $POST and send an update

  // to the database
  SendUpdateToDatabase($_SESSION['username'], $_POST['email']);
  [...]

  echo "Your profile has been successfully updated.";
}
```

Note: Additionally, it's worth noting that the usage of `session_is_registered` is deprecated since PHP 5.3.0. Modern session handling approaches should be considered.
