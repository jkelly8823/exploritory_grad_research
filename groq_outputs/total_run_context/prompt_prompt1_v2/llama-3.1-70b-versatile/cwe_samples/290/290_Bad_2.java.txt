VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
DNS-Based Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses a DNS lookup to obtain the canonical hostname from the remote IP address and checks if it ends with "trustme.com" to determine if the request is trusted. This approach can be vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the DNS response to fake a valid hostname, allowing unauthorized access.

Furthermore, this code snippet relies on a reverse DNS lookup (also known as a PTR record), which can be slow and unreliable. Additionally, attackers can use techniques such as DNS rebinding to exploit this vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of relying solely on DNS-based authentication, consider implementing a more secure authentication mechanism, such as:
1. Authenticate users using a username and password, and verify their credentials against a trusted database.
2. Implement a token-based authentication system, where tokens are generated and verified on the server-side.
3. Use IP-based access control lists to restrict access to trusted IP addresses.

If DNS-based authentication is necessary, ensure that the DNS resolution is properly secured and consider implementing the following:
1. Validate that the DNS response is legitimate and has not been tampered with.
2. Use DNSSEC to authenticate DNS responses.
3. Implement a caching mechanism to minimize DNS lookup times.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {
    trusted = true;
}
