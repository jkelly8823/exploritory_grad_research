VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No security vulnerabilities identified.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a simple Java class representing a Customer entity with standard getter and setter methods for its attributes. The class annotations and method annotations suggest that this is a Java Persistence API (JPA) entity, but there is no apparent security vulnerability in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to follow standard practices for defining a JPA entity in Java.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
@Entity
public class Customer {
 
    private String id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Address address;
    public Customer() {}
    public Customer(String id, String firstName, String lastName) {...}
    @Id
    public String getCustomerId() {...}
    public void setCustomerId(String id) {...}
    public String getFirstName() {...}
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {...}
    public String getLastName() {...}
    public void setLastName(String lastName) {...}
    @OneToOne()
    public Address getAddress() {...}
    public void setAddress(Address address) {...}
 
}
