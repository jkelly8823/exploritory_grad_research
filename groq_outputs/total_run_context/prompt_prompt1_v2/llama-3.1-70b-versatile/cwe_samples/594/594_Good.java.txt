VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure implementation of serialization in the Customer class.

EXPLANATION:
The Customer class implements the Serializable interface, but the code snippet provided does not include any additional protection against Java-specific serialization vulnerabilities. In Java, serialization can be exploited by an attacker if not properly validated, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE). 

However, with the given snippet, it is impossible to know whether the vulnerability is being mitigated elsewhere in the class, because that information is not provided. Nevertheless, the implementation of Serializable without due care should raise alarm bells.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always use the "transient" keyword for sensitive fields.
- Implement the readObject() and writeObject() methods carefully.
- Use serialization frameworks such as Kotlinx Serialization or Jackson that provide additional safeguards.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public class Customer implements Serializable {...}
