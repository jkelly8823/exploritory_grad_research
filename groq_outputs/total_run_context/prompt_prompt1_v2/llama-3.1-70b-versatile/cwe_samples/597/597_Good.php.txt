VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Variable Type Juggling Vulnerability. The code uses loose comparison operator (==) to compare a numeric variable with a string variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The code compares an integer variable $i with a string variable $s1 using the loose comparison operator (==). In PHP, when both operands are of different types, PHP will try to convert one type to the other. In this case, the string variable $s1 is converted to an integer, which results in 65. Therefore, the comparison ($i == $s1) returns true. However, this behavior is not intuitive and can be exploited by an attacker to bypass security checks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use strict comparison operators (===) that compare both the value and the type of the operands. This ensures that the variables being compared are of the same type.

```php
if ($i === $s1)
{
    echo '($i === $s1) is TRUE'. "\n";
}
else
{
    echo '($i === $s1) is FALSE'. "\n";
}
```

Alternatively, convert the variables to the desired type before comparison to ensure type consistency.

```php
if ((int) $i === (int) $s1)
{
    echo '($i === $s1) is TRUE'. "\n";
}
else
{
    echo '($i === $s1) is FALSE'. "\n";
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
var $i = 65;
var $s1 = "65";

if ($i == $s1)
{
    echo '($i == $s1) is TRUE'. "\n";
}
else
{
    echo '($i == $s1) is FALSE'. "\n";
}
```
