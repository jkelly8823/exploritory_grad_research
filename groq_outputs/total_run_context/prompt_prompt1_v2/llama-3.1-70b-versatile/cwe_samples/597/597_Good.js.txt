VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet. The code snippet seems to be testing for type equality in JavaScript using the == operator.

EXPLANATION:
The == operator in JavaScript performs a loose equality check, which means it tries to coerce the operands to a common type before comparing them. This behavior can lead to unexpected results in some cases. However, in this code snippet, the variables i, s1, and s4 are being compared in a way that does not seem to be vulnerable to any type of attack. The variables are being assigned directly and their values are not dependent on any user input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Although no vulnerability is detected, it's recommended to use the === operator instead of the == operator for equality checks in JavaScript to avoid any potential issues due to type coercion.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  <p id="ieq2s1" type="text">(i == s1) is FALSE</p>
                  <p id="s4eq2i" type="text">(s4 == i) is FALSE</p>
                  <p id="s4eq2s1" type="text">(s4 == s1) is FALSE</p>
                  
                  var i = 65;
                  var s1 = '65';
                  var s4 = new String('65');
                  
                  if (i == s1)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("ieq2s1").innerHTML = "(i == s1) is TRUE";
                  }
                  
                  if (s4 == i)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("s4eq2i").innerHTML = "(s4 == i) is TRUE";
                  }
                  
                  if (s4 == s1)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("s4eq2s1").innerHTML = "(s4 == s1) is TRUE";
                  }
