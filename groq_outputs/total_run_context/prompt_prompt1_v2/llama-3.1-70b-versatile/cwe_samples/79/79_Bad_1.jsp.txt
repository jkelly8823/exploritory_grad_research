VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code accepts user input (`eid`) and directly injects it into a SQL query string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `eid` variable. For example, an attacker could inject a value like `" OR 1=1 --"` which would allow them to bypass any security checks and potentially extract sensitive data or disrupt the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use parameterized queries instead of directly injecting user input into the SQL query string. Here's an example of how the code could be rewritten:

```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("select * from emp where id=?");
pstmt.setString(1, eid);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

This code uses a `PreparedStatement` with a parameterized query, which escapes the input data and prevents SQL injection. 

Additionally, the code should also handle potential SQL exceptions and validate the user input data to prevent any potential errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);
if (rs != null) {
    rs.next();
    String name = rs.getString("name");
}
Employee Name: <%= name %>
```
