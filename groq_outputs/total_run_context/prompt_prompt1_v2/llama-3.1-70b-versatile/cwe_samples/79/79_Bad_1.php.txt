VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability and Use of Outdated Functions.

EXPLANATION:
The given code segment contains several critical security issues. Firstly, it uses the `mysql_real_escape_string` function, which is deprecated and can't ensure the security of the input. This can lead to a SQL injection vulnerability.

Moreover, the password is hashed with the `crypt` function using the default settings. However, the vulnerability in SQL injection and deprecated function usage poses a higher risk.

The SQL injection vulnerability can occur due to the use of the `sprintf` function with user-input data ($username and $fullName). An attacker could inject malicious data and potentially take control of the database.

Lastly, the code is vulnerable due to using outdated `mysql_query` and `mysql_real_escape_string`, these functions are included since PHP5.5 and generates E_DEPRECATED-level errors if being used by MySQLi and PDO_MYSQL as they contain significant performance and security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the code should be rewritten using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. 

*   Use PDO or MySQLi, both of which support parameterized queries, instead of the outdated mysql functions.
*   Use the more secure `password_hash` function for password hashing instead of the `crypt` function.
*   Remove the unnecessary quotes in the SQL query string.
*   Use different types of connections or storage engines for passwords to prevent full access to the user's credentials.

```php
$dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=database_name';
$username = 'username';
$password = 'password';

try {
    $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo 'Connection failed: ' . $e->getMessage();
}

$stmt = $pdo->prepare('INSERT INTO users (username, password, fullName) VALUES (:username, :password, :fullName ")");
$stmt->bindParam(':username', $username);
$stmt->bindParam(':password', password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT));
$stmt->bindParam(':fullName', $fullName);
$stmt->execute();
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($username);$fullName = mysql_real_escape_string($fullName);$query = sprintf('Insert Into users (username,password) Values ("%s","%s","%s")', $username, crypt($password),$fullName) ;mysql_query($query);
