VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an XSS attack. It directly takes user input from the `Login.Text` field and assigns it to the `EmployeeID.Text` property. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. An attacker could insert JavaScript code into the `Login` field and it will be executed when the HTML page is rendered, potentially stealing sensitive information or performing malicious actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the user input should be properly sanitized and validated before being displayed on the page. This can be achieved by using the `Server.HtmlEncode()` method to encode the user input or using a whitelist-based validation approach to ensure that only valid data is accepted. Additionally, consider using ASP.NET's built-in XSS protection features, such as the `ValidateRequest` attribute or the `RequestValidator` class.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<%protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox Login;protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label EmployeeID;...EmployeeID.Text = Login.Text;%>
<p><asp:label id="EmployeeID" runat="server" /></p>
```

Note: The exact recommended fix will depend on the specific requirements of the application, but the general principle of sanitizing and validating user input should be followed to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
