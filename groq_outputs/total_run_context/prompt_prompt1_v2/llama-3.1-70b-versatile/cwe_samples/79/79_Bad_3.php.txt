VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through tainted $name variable.

EXPLANATION:
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in this code snippet due to the direct use of user-controlled data in the construction of a string that is then used to generate dynamic content. In this example, the `$name` variable is populated with the value of the "myname" cookie from the user's session. Because this data is not sanitized or sanitized properly before being embedded into the `$announceStr`, it could be exploited to inject malicious JavaScript.

An attacker could manipulate the "myname" cookie to include malicious script content. When this script is saved and then rendered by the application or when other users access the saved announcement, the malicious code is executed. This execution of malicious code creates a sophisticated attack vector for XSS.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Always ensure that user-provided input is validated and sanitized before embedding it into dynamic content. One solution would be to remove any HTML tags from the `$name` variable to prevent any potential scripting attacks. A safer approach would be to use escaping or encoding functions to present the data securely.

Consider modifying the code as below:

```php
$name = $_COOKIE["myname"];
$announceStr = htmlspecialchars($name, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') . " just logged in.";
```
Alternatively, using prepared statements when saving data in a database or replacing user input with an unexploitable placeholder in the final content can also be considered based on the exact requirements and architecture of the application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$name = $_COOKIE["myname"];
$announceStr = "$name just logged in.";

// save HTML-formatted message to file; implementation details are irrelevant for this example.

saveMessage($announceStr);
```
