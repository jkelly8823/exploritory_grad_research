VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the direct rendering of user-provided input into the HTML page.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `request.getParameter("eid")` to retrieve the `eid` parameter from the request and then directly outputs this value to the HTML page using `<%= eid %>`. This creates a potential security vulnerability, as a malicious user could manipulate the `eid` parameter to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or malicious actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to properly encode and sanitize the user-provided input before rendering it to the HTML page. This can be achieved using libraries such as OWASP ESAPI or OWASP Encoder, or built-in encoding functions, to prevent any malicious code from being executed.

For example, using OWASP Encoder's `encodeForHTML()` function:
```java
String eid = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(request.getParameter("eid"));
```
Alternatively, using Java's built-in `String.escapeHtml()` function:
```java
String eid = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(request.getParameter("eid"));
```
It's also recommended to implement additional security measures, such as input validation and whitelisting, to ensure that the `eid` parameter only accepts valid and expected input.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>...Employee ID: <%= eid %>
```
