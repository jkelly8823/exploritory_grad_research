VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds array access.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes an untrusted input from the `GetUntrustedNumber()` function and uses it as an index to assign a value to the `@messages` array. However, it does not perform any bounds checking to ensure that the provided index is valid. If the input is greater than the size of the array, this can cause an out-of-bounds access, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. This type of vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, making it a high-risk issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to perform proper bounds checking on the input value. Here is an example of how to do this:

```perl
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();
my @messages = ();

# Bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds array access
if ($num >= 0 && $num < @messages) {
  $messages[$num] = "Hello World";
} else {
  # Handle invalid input
  print "Invalid input\n";
}
```

Alternatively, you could dynamically allocate the array to ensure it is large enough to accommodate the input index, but this approach has its own set of issues and is not always feasible.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();my @messages = ();
$messages[$num] = "Hello World";
```
