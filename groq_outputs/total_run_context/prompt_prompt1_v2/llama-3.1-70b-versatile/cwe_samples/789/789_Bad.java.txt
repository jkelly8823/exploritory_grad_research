VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) write or allocation due to an untrusted integer being used to determine the size of a dynamically allocated resource.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses an untrusted integer, returned by `GetUntrustedInt()`, to create a new `HashMap` with a size of `size`. Without proper validation, this untrusted value can be used to allocate an exceedingly large amount of memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, or an OOB write if the `HashMap` implementation does not perform bounds checking. This vulnerability can be especially damaging if the returned value is very large, as it could consume all available memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the untrusted integer to ensure it is within expected bounds before using it to allocate the `HashMap`. This can be done by checking if the value is within a reasonable range.
2. Implement a secure method of error handling to prevent the program from crashing in case of invalid input.
3. Consider using a size-limited data structure, such as a vector or array, to prevent excessively large allocations.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned int size = GetUntrustedInt();
HashMap list = new HashMap(size);
```
