VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code contains hard-coded sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a configuration for a JDBC connection to a MySQL database. It contains sensitive information such as the username and password for the database. Hard-coding this information directly in the configuration makes it accessible to anyone with access to the code, which is a significant security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism to store and retrieve sensitive information. This way, even if an unauthorized user gains access to the code, they will not be able to obtain the sensitive information.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. Use a properties file: Store sensitive information in a properties file that is not committed to the version control system.
2. Use environment variables: Set environment variables for the sensitive information and reference them in the configuration.
3. Use a secrets management tool: Utilize a secrets management tool such as Hashicorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.
