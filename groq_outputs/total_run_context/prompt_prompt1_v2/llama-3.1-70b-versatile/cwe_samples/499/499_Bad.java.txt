VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure direct object reference by publicly exposing sensitive data through object reference manipulation.

EXPLANATION:
The class PatientRecord is storing sensitive patient data such as 'name' and 'socialSecurityNum'. While these variables are declared private, which means they can't be accessed directly outside of this class, the 'Patient' constructor is passing them directly as parameters to the 'SetName' and 'SetSocialSecurityNumber' methods.

However, there's no validation on the constructor to ensure that sensitive data isn't being set to arbitrary values, and since these variables are supposed to represent confidential information about the patient, any other part of the program can freely read/write them.

This indirect way of exposing the sensitive data is due to an insecure class design.

Furthermore, it seems we're missing parts of the definition like setName/setSocialSecurityNumber. However, assuming those methods are available elsewhere in the class and they manipulate the private variables directly, these methods also might introduce potential access of low-level pointers through exposure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use more specific variable assignments: like when we handle PII we make sure to validate them properly before they get set, ie  validation from where the input comes.
2. Implement proper secure controls: consider using secure type property features for such.
3. Class Object: Design Classes to prevent access, i.e. private classes in other languages: 

   In other words: Follow more Encapsulation method.



ORIGINAL CODE:
class PatientRecord {private String name;private String socialSecurityNum;public Patient(String name,String ssn) {this.SetName(name);this.SetSocialSecurityNumber(ssn);}}
