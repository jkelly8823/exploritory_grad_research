VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability due to Direct User Input Usage and Insecure Password Storage

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be written in Perl and handles user authentication. However, it directly uses user input ($username) without proper sanitization or validation. Although IsValidUsername() and IsValidPassword() functions are called, we cannot see their implementations in this snippet. If these functions don't sanitize user input properly or use insecure password storage methods, there's a high risk of SQL injection or insecure password storage.

Moreover, using user input directly as a parameter to functions without proper validation or sanitization increases the likelihood of a potential vulnerability. A malicious user could potentially inject malicious SQL or manipulate the input to bypass authentication.

Furthermore, even if IsValidPassword() checks the length of the password or format, the code always reveals whether the username exists or if the login was successful, which can give an attacker some clue about the overall authentication.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add input sanitization and validation on the $username variable before passing it to any function.
- If not using bind placeholders for database queries or other secure methods, use a parameterized query, or whitelisting to securely handle user input.
- Ensure that IsValidPassword() securely stores and verifies passwords, preferably using a salted, hashed method.
- Avoid revealing the existence of a username by always keeping login responses generic and avoid sending specific error messages that could assist attackers in their reconnaissance.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  my $username=param('username');
                  my $password=param('password');
                  
                  if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
                  {
                  if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
                  {
                  print "Login Successful";
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
                  }
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  print "Login Failed - unknown username";
                  }
