VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (Note: We are given an error message with a line number instead of actual code.)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials exposure.

EXPLANATION:
A warning message is present which reveals a MySQL connection issue with a hardcoded credential for the database user 'root' using a password 'N1nj4' at 'localhost'. This indicates that the password is directly embedded in the code instead of being securely stored or retrieved using environment variables or a secure secrets storage service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Refactor the database connection code to use a secure method to retrieve database credentials. Consider using environment variables, a secrets management service, or a secure configuration file.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials directly into the code to prevent unauthorized access to the database in case the code repository or the server hosting the code is compromised.
- Ensure proper access controls, permission management, and secure connections (using SSL/TLS if applicable) when connecting to the database.

ORIGINAL CODE:
