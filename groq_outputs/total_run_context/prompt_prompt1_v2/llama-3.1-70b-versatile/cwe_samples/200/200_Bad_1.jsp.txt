VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential security vulnerability related to debugging, where sensitive information is exposed when the debug mode is enabled.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the sensitive information `acctNo` is exposed to the user when the `debugEnabled` flag is set to `true`. This could lead to unintended disclosure of sensitive data, such as user account numbers. While debugging is essential for development purposes, it's crucial to avoid exposing sensitive information that could be exploited by attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to:

1. Disable debug mode in production environments to prevent exposure of sensitive information.
2. Remove or mask sensitive data from being displayed in debug mode.
3. Implement a secure logging mechanism to record debug information, rather than displaying it directly to the user.
4. Ensure that sensitive information is properly sanitized and validated before being displayed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```erb
<% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
    %>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
```

Note: This vulnerability assumes that `acctNo` contains sensitive information. If this is not the case, the vulnerability may not be relevant. However, as a precaution, it's recommended to follow best practices for handling sensitive data.
