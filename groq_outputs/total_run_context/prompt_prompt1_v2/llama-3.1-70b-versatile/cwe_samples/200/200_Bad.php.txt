VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Information Exposure via an exception.
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability occurs when the code echoes the full exception message ($e->getMessage()) and the configuration file location ($Mysql_config_location) to the user. This allows an attacker to potentially gain sensitive information about the database, such as the database credentials stored in the config file.

The exception message may contain information about the database connection, such as the username and password. By printing this information, the code inadvertently exposes sensitive data to the attacker.

Additionally, the fact that the code is specifically pointing the user to a configuration file implies that the configuration file might contain sensitive information. Printing this location could also compromise the security of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of printing the full exception message and the configuration file location, it would be better to log the exception internally and provide a generic error message to the user. This way, sensitive information is not exposed to the attacker. Here's an example of how the code could be refactored:

    try {
        openDbConnection();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        // Log the full exception for internal investigation
        error_log('Exception caught while trying to open the database connection: ' . $e->getMessage());
        // Provide a generic error message to the user
        echo 'An error occurred while trying to open the database connection. Please check the installation guide for more information.';
    }

ORIGINAL CODE:
    try {openDbConnection();}
    //print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
    catch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';}
