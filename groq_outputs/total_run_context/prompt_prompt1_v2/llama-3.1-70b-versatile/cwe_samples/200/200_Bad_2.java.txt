VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential NullPointerException (NPE) due to unsynchronized access and potential concurrent modification.

EXPLANATION:
The `locationClient.connect()` method is asynchronous, meaning that it does not block the current thread while the connection is being established. The subsequent call to `locationClient.getLastLocation()` may be executed before the connection is established, potentially resulting in a `NullPointerException` if `getLocation` is called before `onConnected` is called.

Additionally, the `locationClient.getLastLocation()` call may return a null value if no location data is available. The code does not check for this null value before attempting to use it, which can also result in a `NullPointerException`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the `getLastLocation()` call only occurs after a successful connection has been established. You can do this by overriding the `onConnected` method of the `LocationClient` and only calling `getLastLocation()` from within this method.

Additionally, you should always check the result of `getLastLocation()` for null before attempting to use it.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
locationClient = new LocationClient(this, this, this);
locationClient.connect();
Location userCurrLocation;
userCurrLocation = locationClient.getLastLocation();
deriveStateFromCoords(userCurrLocation);
```
