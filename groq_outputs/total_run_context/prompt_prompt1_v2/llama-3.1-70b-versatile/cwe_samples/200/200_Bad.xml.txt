VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential Location Leak. The declared permission for fine location does not specify the necessity or usage, which might lead to an implicit collection of user location data, generating potential security issues.

EXPLANATION:
The use of the `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` can be a potential security issue if it's not necessary for the application. 
Fine location access allows location apps to use GPS, cell IDs, and Wi-Fi MAC addresses that could be used to infer a user's home or work locations, generating potential problems of location data compromise or other malicious intent.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider alternatives: 
* Review your application's necessity for location data. If Coarse Location is enough, consider implementing only that permission code (`android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`).
* If Fine Location is necessary, make sure it is an explicit choice made by the user through in-app UI flow.
* Include any relevant documentation containing explanations on location requests. Proper notification can mitigate general end-user security anxiety.
