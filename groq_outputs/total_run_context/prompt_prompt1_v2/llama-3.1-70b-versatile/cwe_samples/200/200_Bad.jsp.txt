VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Sensitive Data Exposure: The code directly outputs sensitive user data, including Social Security Numbers (SSN) and Credit Card Numbers (CCN), to the user interface without proper masking or access controls.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly embeds sensitive user data into the HTML template using ERbRuby syntax. This data is not properly validated, sanitized, or masked, making it easily accessible to unauthorized users who may intercept this data during transmission or view it directly on the webpage. Furthermore, these sensitive identifiers should not be stored or exposed in plaintext under any circumstances.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure this code, the application should implement proper access controls, input validation, and data masking for sensitive user data. Here are some recommended fixes:

1. Mask SSNs and CCNs with asterisks or other placeholder characters to prevent direct exposure.
2. Implement access controls to limit visibility of sensitive data to authorized personnel only.
3. Store sensitive data in a secure environment, such as an encrypted database or secure tokenization system.
4. Use a secure tokenization system to replace sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholders during transmission and storage.
