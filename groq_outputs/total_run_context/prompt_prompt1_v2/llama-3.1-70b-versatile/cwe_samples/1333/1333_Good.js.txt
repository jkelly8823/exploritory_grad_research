VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$` in the `good_pattern` variable can lead to catastrophic backtracking when matched against certain strings, causing the regular expression engine to enter an exponential time complexity. This can cause a significant performance impact and potentially crash the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider simplifying or rewriting the regular expression to avoid the use of nested quantifiers. Here are some possible alternatives:
1. Use a regex debugging tool to identify the problematic pattern and optimize it.
2. Consider using a regex library that can help mitigate ReDoS attacks.
3. Change the regular expression to a simple one that accomplishes the same task without using catastrophic backtracking.

For example, if the intention is to match strings containing only word characters and spaces, a simpler pattern like `^\w[\w\s]*$` can be used.

ORIGINAL CODE:


var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
var good_pattern  = /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
var result = test_string.search(good_pattern);
