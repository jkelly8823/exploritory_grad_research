VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$` in line 3 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when a regular expression can be crafted to take exponential time to process, leading to a denial of service.

In this case, the use of a capturing group (`(\w+)`) followed by a backreference (`\2`) and a quantifier (`*`) creates a vulnerability. An attacker could craft a string that forces the regular expression engine to perform an exponential number of backtracks, leading to a denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider rewriting the regular expression to avoid the use of capturing groups and backreferences. Here are some alternatives:

* Use a possessive quantifier (`++`) instead of a greedy quantifier (`*`) to prevent backtracking: `^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)++$`
* Use a non-capturing group ( `(?:)` ) instead of a capturing group to prevent backreference: `^((?:(\w+))(\w+)\s?)*$`
* Consider using a different approach to validate the input string, such as using a parser or a state machine.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $gdrslt = $test_string;
$gdrslt =~ /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
