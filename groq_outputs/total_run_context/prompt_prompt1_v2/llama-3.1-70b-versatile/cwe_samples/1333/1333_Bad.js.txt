VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack through a regular expression catastrophic backtracking vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `^(\w+\s?)*$` within the `bad_pattern` variable is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. The issue arises from the fact that the `\w+` group and the `\s?` group can both match the same character, causing the regex engine to backtrack excessively when it encounters a string that matches the `\w+` group but not the `\s?` group.

If an attacker is able to input a string that triggers this backtracking, it could potentially cause the application to consume a large amount of CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's recommended to rework the regular expression to avoid the catastrophic backtracking issue. Here are a few possible solutions:

*   Rewrite the regular expression to remove the repeated capturing group and use a possessive quantifier to prevent unnecessary backtracking:
    ```javascript
var bad_pattern  = /^\w+(?:\s\w+)*$/i;
```
*   Use a different approach that doesn't involve a regular expression, such as checking for specific bad characters:

    ```javascript
var bad_chars = "$@#";
for (var i = 0; i < bad_chars.length; i++) {
    if (test_string.includes(bad_chars[i])) {
        result = "contains bad character";
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```javascript
var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern);
```
