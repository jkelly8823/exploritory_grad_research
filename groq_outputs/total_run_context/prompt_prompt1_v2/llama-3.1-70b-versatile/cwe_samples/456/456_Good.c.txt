VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No known vulnerability was found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a simple conditional statement that assigns a string to a variable and then prints it using `printf()`. The code does not seem to handle user-provided input or perform any operations that could lead to known vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or SQL injection. 

However, it's worth noting that without knowing the type of `i` and `err_val`, it's hard to determine if the comparison `i != err_val` will always produce the desired result. But, in terms of security vulnerabilities, this snippet does not raise any concerns.

Also, the variable `test_string` is assigned new string literals, but it does not appear to be writing past its assigned memory or directly manipulating memory contents.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided as no known vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char *test_string = "Done at the beginning";
if (i != err_val)
{
    test_string = "Hello World!";
}
printf("%s", test_string);
