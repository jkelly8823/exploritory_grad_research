VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Unvalidated and Unsanitized User Input, and Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in conjunction with No Output Encoding.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains two major vulnerabilities. Firstly, it directly uses input provided by the user (via the `$_GET` superglobal) without any validation or sanitization. This input is used to retrieve a user record and then to display the data or output it as JSON. 

An attacker could exploit this to access records of any user by manipulating the `user` parameter, resulting in an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.

Furthermore, the `writeToHtmlPage` function is called with unencoded user input, making it vulnerable to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

Additionally, there is no validation on the `json` parameter before it's used to determine the output format, which can lead to issues with system integrity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these vulnerabilities, we recommend:

1. Implementing input validation and sanitization on the `user` and `json` parameters to ensure that they are in an expected format and range of values.
2. Implementing Output Encoding by using a templating engine like Twig or using the `htmlspecialchars` function to prevent XSS attacks.
3. Performing access control checks to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested user record, thus preventing IDOR.
4. Considering using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent any potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
,json = $_GET['json']
$username = $_GET['user']
if(!$json){
  $record = getUserRecord($username);
  foreach($record as $fieldName => $fieldValue){
    if($fieldName == "email_address") {
      // skip displaying user emails
      continue;
    }else{
      writeToHtmlPage($fieldName,$fieldValue);
    }
  }
}else{
  $record = getUserRecord($username);
  echo json_encode($record);
}
```
