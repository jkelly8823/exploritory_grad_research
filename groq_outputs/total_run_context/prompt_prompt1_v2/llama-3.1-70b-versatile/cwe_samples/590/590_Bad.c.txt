VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a potential use-after-free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `foo()` function declares a stack-allocated array `bar` of size `MAX_SIZE`. After some operations, the function calls `free(bar)`, which is incorrect because `bar` is a stack-allocated array, not a dynamically allocated one. Once `free()` is called, the memory space occupied by `bar` is deallocated and considered free for reuse. However, the compiler may not yet have moved the stack pointer, and the old memory region may still contain the values that were stored in `bar`. This memory region could be overwritten by other functions if `free()` is called before the stack frame is destroyed. Calling `free()` on stack-allocated memory can result in the function having unpredictable and unexpected behavior, resulting in a potential use-after-free vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, simply remove the call to `free(bar)`, as stack-allocated memory is automatically cleaned up when the function returns:

```c
void foo(){
    record_t bar[MAX_SIZE];
    
    /* do something interesting with bar */
    
    /* Remove the call to free(bar) */
    return;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void foo(){
    record_t bar[MAX_SIZE];
    
    /* do something interesting with bar */
    
    ...free(bar);
}
```
