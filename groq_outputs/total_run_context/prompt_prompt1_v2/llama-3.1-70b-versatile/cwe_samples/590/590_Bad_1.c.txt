VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory Corruption Due to Freeing a Stack-Allocated Variable

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the `bar` variable is declared as a stack-allocated array using the `record_t bar[MAX_SIZE];` syntax. This type of allocation allocates memory on the stack, rather than the heap. Attempting to free this memory using the `free()` function is undefined behavior and can cause a crash or corruption of the program's memory.

In the function `foo()`, the line `free(bar);` attempts to free the memory allocated for the `bar` array. Since `bar` was not allocated using `malloc()` or another heap allocation function, calling `free()` on it will likely cause undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can either:

1. Remove the `free(bar);` line, as it is unnecessary to free stack-allocated memory. The memory will be automatically freed when the program leaves the scope in which `bar` was declared.

or

2. If the `record_t` array needs to be dynamically allocated, change the declaration of `bar` to use a heap allocation function like `malloc()` or `calloc()`. For example:
   ```c
record_t* bar = malloc(MAX_SIZE * sizeof(record_t));
...
free(bar);
```
   This will allocate memory on the heap and allow it to be safely freed using `free()`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
record_t bar[MAX_SIZE]; //Global var
void foo(){
    /* do something interesting with bar */
    ...free(bar);
}
```
