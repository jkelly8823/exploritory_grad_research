VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to ClassLoader and Dynamic Class Loading.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet uses a URLClassLoader to load a class dynamically. This can be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks, especially if the URL can be controlled by an attacker. An attacker could potentially trick the application into loading malicious classes.
Additionally, the code uses `Class.forName()` to load the class, which can lead to Code Injection. The code attempts to load a class based on its name, and an attacker could potentially inject malicious class names.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate and Whitelist URLs**: Before passing URLs to the URLClassLoader, validate and whitelist them to ensure that they only point to trusted locations.
2. **Avoid Dynamic Class Loading**: Avoid using dynamic class loading whenever possible. Instead, use classes that are explicitly specified in the application code.
3. **Use Secure Coding Practices**: Implement secure coding practices to prevent an attacker from manipulating the class name passed to `Class.forName()`.
4. **Use a Secure Class Loader**: If dynamic class loading is required, consider using a secure class loader that can load classes from a trusted source, and whitelist specific classes.
5. **Implement Additional Security Measures**: Implement additional security measures such as input validation and sanitization to prevent potential Code Injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
