VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This vulnerability is a potential Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and/or exposure of sensitive data (social security number and credit card number).
EXPLANATION:
The code directly outputs sensitive user data, including Social Security Number (SSN) and Credit Card Number (CCN), without any apparent validation, sanitization, or encryption. This suggests that the application may be displaying or using this sensitive information insecurely, potentially exposing users to identity theft and financial fraud.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend that you:
- Store sensitive information (SSN and CCN) securely using encryption.
- Use secure protocols for transmitting sensitive data, such as HTTPS (TLS/SSL).
- Validate and sanitize any input data to ensure it is legitimate and secure.
- Limit access to sensitive information to only those who need it to perform their job duties.
- Consider using a library or framework that provides secure methods for displaying sensitive information.
- Avoid directly displaying sensitive information in the application, and use methods such as tokenization or other obfuscation techniques to protect this data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Social Security Number: <%= ssn %></br>Credit Card Number: <%= ccn %>
