VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials in the connection string.

EXPLANATION:
The connection string contains sensitive information such as the username ('db2admin') and password ('password'). Hardcoding these credentials directly into the connection string poses a significant security risk, especially if this code is publicly accessible or if unauthorized access to the repository is gained.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Move the connection string credentials to a secure location, such as environment variables or a secrets management system. Use placeholders in the connection string and replace them with the actual values at runtime. Alternatively, consider using a configuration file to store sensitive information, and ensure it is not committed to version control.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
