VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Sensitive Data Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains a hardcoded database connection string that includes sensitive data, including the username and password. This is a serious vulnerability as an attacker with access to this code can use the credentials to access the database. Embedding sensitive data directly into the code makes it easier for an attacker to access sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:
- Store sensitive data such as database connection strings, usernames, and passwords outside of the code. Utilize a secure configuration management approach, such as environment variables or an external configuration file.
- Use a secrets manager or a Key Management System (KMS) to securely store, retrieve, and manage sensitive data.
- If necessary, consider implementing a more fine-grained permissions model to restrict access to sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>
