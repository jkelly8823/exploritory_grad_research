Assignment in Conditional Statement

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a conditional statement where the assignment operator (=) is used instead of the comparison operator (==) to check if a certificate is obtained. This allows the certificate to be assigned to the variable "cert" regardless of the outcome, potentially causing unintended behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the assignment operator (=) with a comparison operator (==) to ensure that the conditional statement correctly evaluates the existence of the certificate.

```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // cert is not NULL
}
```

Alternatively, if you need to assign the result to cert, ensure that the assignment is not within the conditional statement.

```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    // cert is valid
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got a certificate, do secret things
}
```
