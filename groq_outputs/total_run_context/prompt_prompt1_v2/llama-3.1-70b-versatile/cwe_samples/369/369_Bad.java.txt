VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Division by Zero and Division Handling

EXPLANATION:
The function computeAverageResponseTime performs integer division without checking if the divisor (numRequests) is zero. This can result in a ArithmeticException if numRequests equals zero. Furthermore, the function does not account for the case where totalTime and numRequests are both zero. In addition, integer division in this scenario can also cause information loss, as integer division will truncate the decimal portion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a validation check for numRequests to ensure it is not zero before performing the division. If it is zero, consider returning an error or throwing an exception.
2. Perform floating point division by casting one of the numbers to a floating point type to get an accurate result, even when the result is not a whole number. This will also avoid information loss caused by integer division.
3. Consider using try-catch blocks to handle and log the ArithmeticException.
 
ORIGINAL CODE:
 
public int computeAverageResponseTime (int totalTime, int numRequests) {return totalTime / numRequests;}
