VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Division By Zero
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains a division function that takes two integer parameters, x and y, and returns their quotient. However, it does not check whether the divisor (y) is zero before performing the division. This oversight allows for a division by zero error, which can lead to a runtime exception or undefined behavior. In some languages and operating systems, division by zero can also be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, you should add input validation to ensure that y is not zero before performing the division. This can be achieved by adding a guard clause to check the value of y and handle the case where it is zero. If y is zero, you can either return an error or throw an exception. The function signature might also be changed to indicate that it throws or returns an error, depending on the chosen approach.

```c
int Division(int x, int y) {
    if (y == 0) {
        // Handle division by zero, e.g., throw an exception or return an error code
        // For demonstration purposes, we'll just return an error code
        return -1; // Or some other error value
    }
    return (x / y);
}
```
Alternatively, your programming language of choice might have a "try-catch" type of paradigm to handle the exception. 

```c
int Division(int x, int y) {
    try {
        return (x / y);
    } catch (DivisionByZeroError) {
        // Handle division by zero
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
int Division(int x, int y){return (x / y);}
