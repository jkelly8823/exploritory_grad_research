VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a potential division by zero vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a function `divide` that takes two `double` parameters `x` and `y` and returns their quotient. However, it does not perform any error checking to ensure that the divisor `y` is non-zero before performing the division. This poses a risk of a division by zero error, which can result in undefined behavior, potentially leading to crashes or incorrect results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, add error checking to ensure that the divisor is non-zero before performing the division. This can be done by throwing an exception or returning an error code when `y` equals zero.

```c
double divide(double x, double y) {
    if (y == 0.0) {
        // Handle the error, for example:
        throw std::runtime_error("Division by zero");
    }
    return x / y;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  double divide(double x, double y){return x/y;}
