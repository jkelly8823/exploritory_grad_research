VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a potential cryptographic weakness due to the use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the SHA-1 hash algorithm to hash a plaintext password. However, SHA-1 is considered a weak and outdated hashing algorithm that is vulnerable to collision attacks. It is also not designed for password storage. A collision attack occurs when two different input strings produce the same output hash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a string that produces the same hash as the stored password, allowing them to bypass authentication.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a stronger, modern hashing algorithm designed for password storage, such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt. These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks. Additionally, using a salt value to randomize the hash output can help prevent rainbow table attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {login_user();}
}
```
