VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of SHA-1 hashing algorithm and non-constant time comparison.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm ("SHA") to hash a password. SHA-1 is considered insecure and has been deprecated due to potential vulnerabilities to collisions. In addition, the comparison of hashed passwords using the equal() function (although not shown in the snippet, we are assuming it's not a constant-time comparison) is vulnerable to timing attacks.

In line 3, MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA") may throw a NoSuchAlgorithmException if the specified algorithm is not available, but in this case, SHA is always available. However, trying to use an insecure hashing algorithm without considering alternatives is a different kind of security vulnerability.

In line 4, the password that is being hashed is referenced as password in the code, however based on variable naming conventions, password seems to be used in place of encer here. So it seems like encer should be used in place of password.

In any case, using SHA is insecure as secure hash functions must be almost collision-free and pre-image-resistant and must display two properties specifically as follows:
- the hash must exhibit high entropy of n2^ (e.g. it takes at least 2^n steps to compute the function).
- it must be non-redundant, non-one-way-function which means it must not exhibit homorphism.
Using it for sensitive data like passwords significantly increases the risk of data breaches. Notably, the use of non-constant time comparison in equal() further undermines password security, potentially opening the application to timing attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Switch to a more secure hashing algorithm such as Argon2, PBKDF2 or Bcrypt.
- Consider using a constant-time comparison method to compare hashed passwords to the one provided, reducing the risk of timing attacks.
- Ensure that all cryptographic operations are securely seeded with sufficient randomness and entropy to avoid brute-force attacks.
- Consider adopting a different authentication mechanism rather than re-inventing wheel around storing hashes.



ORIGINAL CODE:
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
//Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}
