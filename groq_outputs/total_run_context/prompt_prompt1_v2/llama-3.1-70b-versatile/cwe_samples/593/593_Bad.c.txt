VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure password handling for SSL contexts. Hardcoded passwords are present.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates insecure practices when handling passwords for SSL contexts. Hardcoded passwords are used in the code, specifically in lines 7, 11, 13, and 17. This is a significant security risk as it allows an attacker to extract the passwords if they gain access to the code. Furthermore, line 17 attempts to set a default password callback function for the SSL context but does not actually implement a callback function. 

Instead, a hardcoded string is provided which poses the same security risks as hardcoded passwords. Additionally, it's crucial to handle errors properly when dealing with sensitive operations like initializing an SSL context and setting passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace hardcoded passwords with environment variables or secure storage mechanisms.
2. Implement a callback function for the SSL context's default password.
3. Ensure error handling is implemented for all sensitive operations, including SSL context initialization and password setting.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define CERT "secret.pem"#define CERT2 "secret2.pem"
int main(){
    SSL_CTX *ctx;SSL *ssl;init_OpenSSL();seed_prng();
    ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_method());
    if (SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file(ctx, CERT) != 1)int_error("Error loading certificate from file");
    
    if (SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, CERT, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) != 1)int_error("Error loading private key from file");
    
    if (!(ssl = SSL_new(ctx)))int_error("Error creating an SSL context");
    
    if ( SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb(ctx, "new default password" != 1))int_error("Doing something which is dangerous to do anyways");
    
    if (!(ssl2 = SSL_new(ctx)))int_error("Error creating an SSL context");
}
