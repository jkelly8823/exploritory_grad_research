VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to persist a user's login credentials in a cookie, potentially insecurely storing sensitive data. This is because the storage of sensitive data, such as passwords, in plaintext cookies poses a serious security risk, especially if the data is not transmitted over a secure protocol. Furthermore, even if the data is transmitted over HTTPS, a cookie's storage on the client-side can still be vulnerable to various types of attacks.

Additionally, the use of the `setcookie` function to store a PHP array into a cookie can lead to issues. The `setcookie` function serializes the value before storing it as a string, using the `serialize` function. This can result in a serialized string that contains the password in plaintext. This data can be stored on the client-side and can be intercepted by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Prefer server-side sessions for storing sensitive data instead of client-side cookies.
2. Use secure protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between the client and server.
3. Use secure password hashing functions (e.g., `password_hash`) to securely store passwords, instead of plaintext.
4. Avoid storing sensitive data (like passwords) in cookies. If you must store this data, ensure it is encrypted and properly secured.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
function persistLogin($username, $password){$data = array("username" => $username, "password"=> $password);setcookie ("userdata", $data);}
