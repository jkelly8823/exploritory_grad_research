VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated memory allocation, potential buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet allocates memory using the malloc() function with the size determined by the product of `sizeof(img_t)` and `num_imgs`. However, there is no validation check for the return value of get_num_imgs() to ensure it's within a reasonable range. Also, the code does not check the result of the malloc() function to handle potential memory allocation failures. This may lead to a buffer overflow if `num_imgs` is a large value, potentially causing the system to crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the return value of get_num_imgs() to ensure it's within a reasonable range and not larger than the maximum allowed.
- Check the result of the malloc() function to handle potential memory allocation failures.
- Consider using a more modern memory management function like calloc() or realloc() which allows for more sophisticated error handling.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
...
```
