VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The while loop continues to append data to the `buf` array without checking whether it has exceeded the buffer size `SOMEBIGNUM`. If `MAXGET` is greater than `SOMEBIGNUM`, this could lead to a buffer overflow.

In a buffer overflow attack, an attacker could send a large amount of data to overflow the `buf` array and potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.

Additionally, the code snippet uses `getFromInput` function without checking its return value, which may lead to further security vulnerabilities. It is assumed that `getFromInput` function is properly implemented to handle malformed input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the return value of `getFromInput` function to ensure that it doesn't exceed the remaining buffer space.
2. Implement bounds checking to prevent writing beyond the end of the `buf` array. 
3. Use safer function calls that prevent overflowing the `buf` array, such as `getFromInput` with a specified size.
4. Use memory-safe libraries or functions, if available in the programming language.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
short int bytesRec = 0;char buf[SOMEBIGNUM];
while(bytesRec < MAXGET) {bytesRec += getFromInput(buf+bytesRec);}
```
