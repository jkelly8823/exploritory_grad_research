VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds array access vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. The variable `array1[x]` is multiplied by `4096` and the result is used as an index for `array2`. If the value of `array1[x] * 4096` exceeds the bounds of `array2`, it can lead to memory corruption or access to unintended memory locations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, bounds checking should be performed on the index before accessing `array2`. Additionally, consider checking the value of `array1[x]` to prevent potential integer overflows when multiplying by `4096`. 

```
if (x < array1_size && array1[x] * 4096 < array2_size) {
    y = array2[array1[x] * 4096];
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (x < array1_size)
    y = array2[array1[x] * 4096];
```
