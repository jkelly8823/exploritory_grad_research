VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a simple function that locks a mutex, accesses a shared resource, and then unlocks the mutex. This is a common and correct pattern for synchronizing access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. The function correctly locks the mutex before accessing the shared resource and unlocks it afterward, preventing potential data races and deadlocks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
    
    /* access shared resource */
    
    
    pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
```
