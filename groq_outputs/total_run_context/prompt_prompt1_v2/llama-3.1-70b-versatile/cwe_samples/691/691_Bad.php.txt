VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A Potential File Inclusion Vulnerability has been identified. Unsanitized user input is used to include files, which could lead to arbitrary file inclusion or Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack.

EXPLANATION:
The `printFile` function reads the contents of a file and outputs it. The filename is passed as an argument to the function. However, no validation or sanitization is performed on this input. This allows an attacker to potentially read or access files that they are not authorized to access, including sensitive data files or configuration files.

Additionally, if the file is not found, a generic error message is displayed. This could potentially be used by an attacker to gather information about the file system or the location of sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `$filename` input to prevent any potential file inclusion attacks. This could involve using a whitelist of allowed files or directories.
2. Use full path to files or directory when using `file_get_contents()`.
3. Handle errors more securely, instead of displaying generic error messages that could be used by attackers. Consider logging the error instead.
4. Ensure proper file system permissions are set on sensitive files to prevent unauthorized access.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
  //read file into string
  $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
}
```
