VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Inconsistent Semicolon Usage Leading to Execution of Unintended Code
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet utilizes an inconsistent approach to statement separation. The line 'if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();' attempts to execute Do_X only when 'condition' is true. However, the function Do_Y is executed regardless of the condition due to the missing curly brackets around the if statement and the placement of the semicolon after Do_X. This leads to potential execution of unintended code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, curly brackets should be used to encapsulate the intended code to be executed within the if statement. Additionally, consider removing the superfluous parenthesis around the 'condition' term within the if statement. Here's a revised version of the code:
``` 
if(condition==true)
{
  Do_X();
}
Do_Y();
```
Alternatively, since it seems like Do_Y is intended to be executed always regardless of the condition, consider reorganizing the code in this manner:

```
if(condition==true)
{
  Do_X();
}
Do_Y();
```
If Do_Y's execution depends on the same condition, it should be included within the curly brackets as well.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
```
