VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and Unauthorized File Access vulnerabilities are present in this code.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack because the `readlink` function does not perform any validation on theSYM link destination. An attacker could create a symbolic link that points to a sensitive file outside of the intended directory, and the `readlink` function would resolve it, potentially disclosing or leaking the sensitive file's contents.

Additionally, the code has an Unauthorized File Access vulnerability. The `file_get_contents` function reads the contents of the `$realFile` file, which is not checked if it's within the intended directory. An attacker could manipulate the `$filename` variable to point to any file on the system.

Furthermore, it is assumed that `$realFile` is equal to `$filename`, but this is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet. The variable `$realFile` is used without being initialized anywhere in the given code, which might cause issues. It is assumed that `$realFile` should be equal to `$filename` in this case.

The variable `$user` and the `getCurrentUser` and `fileowner` functions suggest that the code is trying to enforce some kind of file access control, but this is undermined by the lack of input validation and the potential path traversal vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure way to canonicalize file paths, such as using `realpath` function, which resolves symbolic links and converts the result to an absolute path.
2. Use a whitelist-based approach to validate the paths and only allow certain paths to be accessed.
3. Initialize and define variables before they are used.
4. Use secure functions such as `file_get_contents` only when you are sure that the file path is valid and does not pose any security risk.
5. Implement proper access control and authorization checks to prevent unauthorized file access.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();
    
    //resolve file if its a symbolic link
    if(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}
    if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}
}
```
