VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is an authentication bypass vulnerability. In a catch block, a custom exception message is being created with the username and password.
EXPLANATION:
In the catch block, a custom exception message is being created with the username and password, including both in the message. This is a potential security risk because it could potentially leak sensitive information about the credentials that were used in a failed login attempt. This exception message could potentially be logged or exposed in an error message, depending on how the application handles this error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the exception message should be rewritten to not include the username and password. Instead, it could include a more general message that still conveys the failure of the login while keeping the credentials private. Here is an example of how to do this:
```java
// Instead of this
throw new FailedLoginException("Failed Login for user " + username + " with password " + password);

// Use this
throw new FailedLoginException("Failed Login for user " + username + " with incorrect password");
```
Alternatively, you could just not include any specific information about the credentials in the exception message, to make the error message even more general:
```java
// Instead of this
throw new FailedLoginException("Failed Login for user " + username + " with password " + password);

// Use this
throw new FailedLoginException("Login failed - invalid credentials");
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class BankManagerLoginServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        try {
            // Get username and password from login page request
            String username = request.getParameter("username");
            String password = request.getParameter("password");
            // Authenticate user
            BankManager bankMgr = new BankManager();
            boolean isAuthentic = bankMgr.authenticateUser(username, password);
            // If user is authenticated then go to successful login page
            if (isAuthentic) {
                request.setAttribute("login", new String("Login Successful."));
                getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/BankManagerServiceLoggedIn.jsp").forward(request, response);
            } else {
                // Otherwise, raise failed login exception and output unsuccessful login message to error page
                throw new FailedLoginException("Failed Login for user " + username + " with password " + password);
            }
        } catch (FailedLoginException ex) {
            // output failed login message to error page
            request.setAttribute("error", new String("Login Error"));
            request.setAttribute("message", ex.getMessage());
            getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/ErrorPage.jsp").forward(request, response);
        }
    }
}
