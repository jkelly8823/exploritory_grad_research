Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code provided takes untrusted input, presumably from a user, and incorporates it directly into a filename. Although it attempts to remove parent directory references (`..`) from the input, this is not a robust defense against path traversal attacks. A determined attacker could still potentially access files outside of the intended directory.

In this specific case, the variable `$Username` is not properly sanitized before its value is used to construct the `$filename`. This allows for potential path traversal vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the contents of `$Username`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should properly sanitize and validate the input before using it to construct a filename. Additionally, using a white-list based approach for filename validation would be better than a black-list approach. Here's an example of a recommended fix:

 Use a library to properly sanitize and validate the input.
 Instead of directly appending user input to a critical string, use `File::Spec` to construct filenames securely.
 Validate the resulting filename against a white-list of allowed values.

The revised code might look something like this:

```perl
use File::Spec;

my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/[^a-zA-Z0-9,_-]//g;  # Whitelist characters
my $filename = File::Spec->catfile("/home/user", $Username);
# Further validation here
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
