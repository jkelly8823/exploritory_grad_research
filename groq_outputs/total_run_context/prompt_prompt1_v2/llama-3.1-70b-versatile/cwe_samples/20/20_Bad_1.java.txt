VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a potential OutOfMemoryError due to untrusted user input.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes an 'untrustedListSize' as input and uses it to create an array of 'Widget' objects without proper bounds checking. Although there is a check for negative numbers, there is no check for extremely large numbers that could cause an OutOfMemoryError when attempting to allocate memory for the 'Widget' array. Additionally, the error handling mechanism is not secure. It's generally not a good idea to output a message like "die evil hacker!" as it could reveal information about the system or application to a potential attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, add a bounds check to prevent extremely large numbers. It would be better to define what a reasonable list size is and enforce it. 

```java
private void buildList (int untrustedListSize) {
    int maxLength = 1000;  // define the maximum allowed length
    if (untrustedListSize < 0 || untrustedListSize > maxLength) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid list size");
    }
    Widget[] list = new Widget[untrustedListSize];
    if (untrustedListSize > 0) {
        list[0] = new Widget();
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
private void buildList ( int untrustedListSize ){if ( 0 > untrustedListSize ){die("Negative value supplied for list size, die evil hacker!");}Widget[] list = new Widget [ untrustedListSize ];list[0] = new Widget();}
