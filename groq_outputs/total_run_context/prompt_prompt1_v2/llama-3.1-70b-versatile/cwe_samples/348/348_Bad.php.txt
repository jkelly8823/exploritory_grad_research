VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to an IP spoofing attack through the use of the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header.

EXPLANATION:
The code is trying to get the requesting IP address from the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header. However, this header can be easily spoofed by an attacker by adding it to the request headers. This can be done using a tool like curl or by modifying the request headers in a browser's developer tools. The code then checks if the requesting IP address is in an allowlist, which can be bypassed by spoofing the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header to an IP address that is in the allowlist.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of relying on the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header, consider using a reverse proxy or a load balancer that sets the 'X-Forwarded-For' header correctly. Additionally, validate the IP address obtained from 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' against the 'REMOTE_ADDR' to prevent IP spoofing attacks. If the IP addresses do not match, consider the request as suspicious and block it.

Alternatively, you can add additional validation to ensure that the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header is being set by a trusted proxy server by checking the 'X-Forwarded-For-Original' or 'X-Forwarded-For-Initial' headers.

It's also recommended to review the $ipAllowlist to ensure that it is being populated from a trusted source and is being updated regularly to reflect any changes in the network configuration.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  $requestingIP = '0.0.0.0';if (array_key_exists('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', $_SERVER)) {$requestingIP = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
                     else{$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];}
                     if(in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowlist)){generatePage();return;}else{echo "You are not authorized to view this page";return;}
