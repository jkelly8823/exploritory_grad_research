VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Information Exposure
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet exhibits an information exposure vulnerability. In the event of an exception, it prints out a message that includes the path to the configuration file ($Mysql_config_location). This can be particularly damaging if the configuration file contains sensitive information such as database credentials. An attacker could potentially use this information to further compromise the application or its underlying data storage.

An additional concern is that the exact exception message is echoed back to the user. This can potentially leak sensitive information about the application's internal state or the error that occurred.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of echoing the exact exception message and configuration file path, consider logging the error on the server-side and providing a generic error message to the user. This way, sensitive information is not accidentally exposed.

Consider using a separate logging mechanism that stores the exact exception message and configuration file path for debugging purposes, but is inaccessible to malicious users.

Additionally, ensure that error messages are sanitized to prevent any potential information leakage.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
try {openDbConnection();}
//print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
catch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';}
```
