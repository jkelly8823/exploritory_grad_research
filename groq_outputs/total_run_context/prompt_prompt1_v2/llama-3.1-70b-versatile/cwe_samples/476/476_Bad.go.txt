VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Resource leak in case of an error, incorrect handling of the connection in the `client.Do(request)` call, and potential information disclosure through error messages.

EXPLANATION:
In the `HandleRequest` function, the `defer response.Body.Close()` statement is executed regardless of whether the `client.Do(request)` call succeeds or fails. However, if `client.Do(request)` fails and `err` is not `nil`, the `response` will be `nil` as well. This will cause a panic when `response.Body.Close()` is executed. 

Additionally, if the request fails and `err` is not `nil`, the error is directly returned. This can potentially disclose sensitive information about the system to an attacker. It is generally better to log the error and then return a more generic error message to the user.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Firstly, it is essential to handle the error and check for `nil` before deferring `response.Body.Close()`. This can be achieved by executing `defer response.Body.Close()` inside the if statement where the response is not `nil`. Secondly, log the error before returning it to prevent information disclosure.

Here's an improved version of the code:

```go
func HandleRequest(client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    if err != nil {
        // log the error before returning it to prevent information disclosure
        log.Printf("failed to execute request: %v", err)
        return nil, errors.New("Failed to execute request")
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()
    // ...
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```go
func HandleRequest(client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    defer response.Body.Close()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // ...
}
```
