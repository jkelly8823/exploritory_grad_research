VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the strcpy function.
EXPLANATION:
The function host_lookup calls strcpy to copy the hostname from hp->h_name into the hostname buffer. However, the buffer size (64) is not checked, and strcpy does not perform any bounds checking. If hp->h_name contains a string longer than 63 characters, it can overflow the hostname buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer string copying function like strncpy or snprintf, which allows specifying the maximum number of characters to copy.
- Increase the size of the hostname buffer to accommodate longer hostnames, or dynamically allocate memory for the hostname string based on its actual length.
- Check the length of hp->h_name before copying it to ensure it will not overflow the buffer.

Here's a safer version of the vulnerable line:

    strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, 64);
    hostname[63] = '\0'; // Ensure null-termination

Note: The recommendation to use strncpy is a simple fix but it will not prevent buffer overflows if the string to be copied is longer than 64 characters. A more secure approach would be to dynamically allocate memory for the hostname string.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
                        struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
                           
                           /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */
                           
                           validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
                     }
