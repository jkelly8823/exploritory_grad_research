VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unsolicited System Exit and Insecure Error Handling

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a catch block for an ApplicationSpecificException, where it logs the error message using the toString() method and then calls System.exit(1). This approach has two issues: 

1. Unsolicited System Exit: Calling System.exit() directly can terminate the entire application, leading to potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or unhandled exceptions. 

2. Insecure Error Handling: Logging the exception using toString() can potentially reveal sensitive information. The toString() method is designed for human-readable output, and its implementation is not under the control of the logging code. An attacker could exploit this by throwing an exception with a malicious toString() implementation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these issues:

1. Avoid using System.exit() directly. Instead, allow the application to handle the exception and terminate elegantly. This can be achieved by re-throwing the exception or returning an error response to the client.

2. Handle exceptions securely by logging them using a secure logging mechanism. This can involve using a logging framework that provides secure logging functionality. For instance, consider using the logging API provided by the Java logging framework or a third-party logging library like Logback or Log4j.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());System.exit(1);}}
