VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to Potential Information Disclosure and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The getServerStatus() function is being called without proper validation of the IP address against the ipAllowList. Although the requesting IP address is being checked at the beginning of the script, the lack of exit or die statements after the http_redirect function call could potentially allow an attacker to execute subsequent code if the redirect fails for some reason.

EXPLANATION:
The initial check of the IP address against the ipAllowList appears to be a security measure. However, the redirect after displaying the authorization message might not successfully exit the script. If the redirect fails for some reason, such as misconfiguration or the url being unresponsive, the subsequent code will still be executed. This allows a potential attacker to bypass the IP check and gain unauthorized access to the page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended that a proper exit or die statement be added after the redirect to prevent further execution of the script.

```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; 
if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){ 
    echo "You are not authorized to view this page"; 
    http_redirect($errorPageURL); 
    exit; // Add this to ensure the script exits after the redirect
}
```

Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to handle scenarios where the redirect fails.

```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; 
if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){ 
    echo "You are not authorized to view this page"; 
    if (http_redirect($errorPageURL)) {
        exit;
    } else {
        // Handle redirect failure
        // Display an error message to the user, log the error, etc.
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page";http_redirect($errorPageURL);}$status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
```
