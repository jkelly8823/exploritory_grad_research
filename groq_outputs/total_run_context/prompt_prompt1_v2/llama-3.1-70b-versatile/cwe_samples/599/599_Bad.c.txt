VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Assignment instead of comparison in the if condition.

EXPLANATION:
The issue is with the line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))`. Here, the `=` operator is used for assignment, not comparison. This means that the code will always evaluate to true, regardless of the value returned by `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)`. This could potentially lead to a situation where a null or non-trusted certificate is treated as valid.

The intention seems to be to check if a valid certificate was retrieved, but the single `=` operator is incorrect for this purpose.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, use the `==` operator for comparison instead of assignment.

```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // ...
}
```

However, given that `cert` is presumably initialized with the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` before this if statement, a more idiomatic way to write this would be:

```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    // ...
}
```

This way, it's clear that you're checking if `cert` is `NULL` or not.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
        
     // got certificate, host can be trusted
           
     
     //foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);

     
     
     //if (X509_V_OK==foo) ...
     
  
 }
```
