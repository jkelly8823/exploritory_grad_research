VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Sensitive Credentials.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains hardcoded usernames and passwords for LDAP authentication, which is a serious security vulnerability. This is because an attacker with access to the code repository could easily obtain the credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the LDAP system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration system to store sensitive credentials.
2. Consider using a secrets manager, such as HashiCorp Vault, to store and manage sensitive data.
3. Consider using a credential management system that supports secure storage, rotation, and revocation of credentials.
4. Remove hardcoded credentials and replace them with placeholders or secure references.
5. Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted, both at rest and in transit, to prevent unauthorized access.
