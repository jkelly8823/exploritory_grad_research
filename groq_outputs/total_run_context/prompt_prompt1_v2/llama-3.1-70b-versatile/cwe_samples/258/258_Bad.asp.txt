VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Clear-text database credentials in configuration files.

EXPLANATION:
The provided XML configuration snippet contains database connection strings. Although the password is empty, this snippet suggests that the connection string may be stored in clear text elsewhere. Storing database credentials in clear text within configuration files poses a significant security risk, as they can be easily obtained by unauthorized users or attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a vault or a secure storage mechanism to store sensitive information such as database credentials.
2. Encrypt database connection strings using a secure encryption algorithm, if storage in plain text cannot be avoided.
3. Avoid storing sensitive information within version-controlled configuration files.
4. Use environment variables or other mechanisms to provide this information to the application.
