VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential timing attack vulnerability exists due to the insecure implementation of resetting the `data` array.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, it appears that the `data` array is being cleared by setting all elements to zero when specific conditions are met. However, this approach can be vulnerable to timing attacks. A determined attacker can potentially exploit the fact that the clearing process may take a variable amount of time depending on the input, which can leak sensitive information.

In particular, the lines of code responsible for setting the `data` array elements to zero are repeated for each element. This repetition may introduce a timing difference between clearing the array with a large amount of data and clearing it with a small amount of data. This discrepancy can potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain insights into the data being processed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a secure and constant-time method for clearing the `data` array. This can be achieved by using a loop that iterates over each element and sets it to zero, ensuring that the time taken is independent of the input data. Additionally, consider using a more secure method for handling sensitive data, such as using a cryptographic library that provides secure data handling capabilities.

For example, the clearing process could be rewritten as follows:

```verilog
integer i;
always @(posedge clk_i)
begin
    // ...
    if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_3))
    begin
        // ...
        data <= 0;
    end
    else if(hashValid && ~hashValid_r)
    begin
        // Use a loop to clear the data array
        for(i = 0; i < 16; i = i + 1)
        begin
            data[i] <= 0;
        end
    end
    // ...
end
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
...
    // Implement SHA256 I/O memory map interface
    // Write side
    always @(posedge clk_i)
    
        begin
            
            if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_3))
            
                begin
                    
                    startHash <= 0;
                    newMessage <= 0;
                    data[0] <= 0;
                    data[1] <= 0;
                    data[2] <= 0;
                    ...
                    data[14] <= 0;
                    data[15] <= 0;
                    
                end
                
            else if(hashValid && ~hashValid_r)
            
                begin
                    
                    data[0] <= 0;
                    data[1] <= 0;
                    data[2] <= 0;
                    ...
                    data[14] <= 0;
                    data[15] <= 0;
                    
                end
                
            
        
    ...
