VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, no potential vulnerabilities were identified. The code appears to be implementing a digital circuit in Verilog, specifically an SHA256 I/O memory map interface. The code snippet initializes variables or registers when the reset signals (`rst_ni` and `rst_3`) are asserted, which is a common practice in digital circuit design.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are provided, as no vulnerabilities or issues were detected in the code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```verilog
// Implement SHA256 I/O memory map interface
// Write side
always @(posedge clk_i)
    begin
        if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_3))
            begin
                startHash <= 0;
                newMessage <= 0;
                data[0] <= 0;
                data[1] <= 0;
                data[2] <= 0;
                ...
                data[14] <= 0;
                data[15] <= 0;
            end
    end
