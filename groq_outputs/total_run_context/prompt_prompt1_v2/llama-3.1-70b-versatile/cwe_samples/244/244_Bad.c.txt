VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory reallocation with sensitive data
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet reallocates memory for a buffer holding sensitive data (cleartext_buffer) without clearing or overwriting the original memory location first. This can lead to sensitive data remaining in the original memory location, potentially exposing it.

The scrub_memory function is called after reallocation, but it is unclear if it successfully overwrites all of the original memory location's contents. If scrub_memory is not guaranteed to overwrite all of the original memory, the sensitive data may still be exposed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Before reallocating memory for sensitive data, ensure the original memory location is cleared or overwritten. It is recommended to securely erase the original buffer before reallocating memory. This can be achieved by using a secure erase function or by manually overwriting the original buffer with a secure pattern (e.g., zeros).

Additionally, ensure the scrub_memory function is correctly implemented to overwrite all allocated memory regions to prevent data exposure. Alternatively, consider using a secure allocation and deallocation library that automatically handles sensitive data memory management.

ORIGINAL CODE:
cleartext_buffer = get_secret();
...
cleartext_buffer = realloc(cleartext_buffer, 1024);
...
scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer, 1024);
