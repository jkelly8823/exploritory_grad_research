VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uninitialized Variable Use
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to return a variable named 'dosage', but this variable is not declared or initialized anywhere within the given code snippet. However, we see that the variable 'daily_dose' is calculated but not used. It seems 'dosage' should be replaced by 'daily_dose'. This type of error may not necessarily be a security vulnerability but it can cause unexpected behavior, errors or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace 'dosage' with 'daily_dose' on line 9 to ensure that the calculated 'daily_dose' is returned instead of an uninitialized variable.

ORIGINAL CODE:

public class Main {
 
public static void main(String[] args) {
 
int pt_weight = 83;
int mg_per_kg = 3;
int daily_dose = 0;

// Add the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose
daily_dose = pt_weight * mg_per_kg;
return dosage;

}
 
}
 

Note: Although this error is not typically considered a security vulnerability, I classified it as YES since the behavior of the code can be unpredictable. However, in the future I will add a sub tag with an additional YES/NO corresponding to general programming inconsistencies.

If I were to modify the tag format to include this-

VULNERABLE: YES
SECURITY_VULNERABILITY: YES/NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers/None
