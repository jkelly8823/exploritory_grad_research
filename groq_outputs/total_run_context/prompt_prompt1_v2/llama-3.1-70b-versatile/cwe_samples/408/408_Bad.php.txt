VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Directory Traversal and File Inclusion Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `printFile` function reads the contents of a file using the `file_get_contents` function and outputs it directly. The `$filename` parameter, which is not properly validated or sanitized, is passed directly to the `file_get_contents` function. This can lead to a directory traversal and file inclusion vulnerability, allowing an attacker to read or include sensitive files on the system, potentially leading to a breach of confidentiality or even remote code execution.

The fact that the `isOwnerOf` function checks the ownership of the file is not sufficient to prevent this vulnerability, as an attacker could still potentially manipulate the `$filename` parameter to read sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the `$filename` parameter should be properly validated and sanitized to ensure that it does not include any directory traversal characters (e.g., `../` or `..\`). Additionally, the `file_get_contents` function should be used with caution and should not be relied upon for reading sensitive files. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a file descriptor or a secure file inclusion mechanism.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to fix this vulnerability:
```php
function printFile($username, $filename) {
    $baseDir = '/path/to/secure/directory/';
    if (isOwnerOf($username, $filename)) {
        $filePath = $baseDir . basename($filename);
        if (file_exists($filePath) && is_readable($filePath)) {
            $file = file_get_contents($filePath);
            echo $file;
            return true;
        }
    }
    echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
    return false;
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    //read file into string
    $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
}
```
