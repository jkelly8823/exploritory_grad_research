VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Generation of Session ID and Missing Secure Flag in Cookie Options

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet generates a session ID using the `generateSessionId()` function and sets a cookie named 'sessionid' with the generated ID. However, there are two potential security issues. Firstly, the function used to generate the session ID is not provided, so it's unclear whether the ID is generated securely. If the ID is not generated securely, it may be vulnerable to prediction or brute-force attacks. Secondly, the cookie options do not include the `secure` flag, which means that the cookie will be transmitted over insecure channels (e.g., HTTP). This makes the session ID vulnerable to interception by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the `generateSessionId()` function generates IDs securely using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). If the function does not generate IDs securely, consider using a proven secure ID generation mechanism.
2. Add the `secure` flag to the cookie options to ensure that the cookie is only transmitted over secure channels (e.g., HTTPS). This will prevent interception of the session ID by an attacker.
3. Consider adding the `httponly` flag to the cookie options to prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie. This will prevent certain types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
4. Consider using a more secure cookie name to avoid leaking information about the application's functionality.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
let sessionId = generateSessionId()
let cookieOptions = { domain: 'example.com' }
response.cookie('sessionid', sessionId, cookieOptions)
