VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a double-free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using the `malloc` function and stores the pointer in the `ptr` variable. However, it then frees the same memory in two places: within the `if (abrt)` block and again outside of the `if` statement. This results in an attempt to free the same memory location twice. The `free` function is called on a pointer that has already been freed, which can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or a segmentation fault.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, remove the second call to `free(ptr)`, outside the `if` statement. The second `free` is unnecessary because the memory has already been freed within the `if` statement. However, this fix assumes that the intent was to free the memory only once. If the intent was to free the memory in both the `if` and `else` branches, the code should be rewritten to only free the memory once, for example:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
} else {
    // use ptr here
    free(ptr);
}
```
Alternatively, set `ptr` to `NULL` after freeing it to prevent accidental double-free:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
}
...
// use ptr here
free(ptr);
```
This fix assumes that the `else` branch uses the `ptr` and should free it as well. Note that this is just a hypothetical fix as the actual use of `ptr` in the `else` branch is unknown.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
}
...
free(ptr);
```
