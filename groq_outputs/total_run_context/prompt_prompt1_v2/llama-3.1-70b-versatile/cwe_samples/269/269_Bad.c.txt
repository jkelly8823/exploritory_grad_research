VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Privilege escalation due to incorrect handling of seteuid.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the unconditional call to `seteuid(0)`, which sets the effective user ID to 0 (typically the root user). While this may be necessary for certain operations, it is followed by a call to `seteuid(getuid())`, which resets the effective user ID to the current real user ID. However, between these two calls, any code execution could potentially exploit the elevated privileges.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using `seteuid(0)` unless absolutely necessary. If privileges are required, consider using a more targeted approach such as Linux capabilities.
- If `seteuid(0)` must be used, ensure it is done within a secure context and that any intervening code is reviewed for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- Use `setresuid` or `setreuid` instead of `seteuid` to manage both the real and effective user IDs, ensuring that the real user ID is set to root only when necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:

            seteuid(0);
            /* do some stuff */
            
            seteuid(getuid());
