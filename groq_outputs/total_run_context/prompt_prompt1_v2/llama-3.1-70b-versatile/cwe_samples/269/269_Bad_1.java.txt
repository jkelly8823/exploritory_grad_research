VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
After reviewing the provided code snippet, I have determined that there are no apparent vulnerabilities present. The code appears to be implementing access control based on user roles, which is a commonly used security mechanism.

However, it is worth noting that this assessment is based solely on the code snippet provided, and it is always possible that vulnerabilities may exist in other parts of the codebase.

One potential issue is that the code does not handle the case where the `requestingUser` does not have a `role` assigned (i.e., `null`). This could result in a `NullPointerException`, but this would be a runtime error rather than a security vulnerability.

Additionally, the `isAuthenticated` method is not shown in the provided code snippet, so it is not possible to assess its security.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public enum Roles {ADMIN, USER, GUEST}
public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser) {
    if (isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
        switch (requestingUser.role) {
            case GUEST:
                System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println(currentDebugState());
                break;
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");
    }
}
```
