VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded sensitive information exposure.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains hardcoded hexadecimal values (32'hF00 and 32'h800F00) which are apparently being used for authentication purposes. Hardcoding sensitive information, like IP addresses or authentication values, into the code can pose a significant security risk. If this code is accessible to unauthorized individuals, they can easily obtain this sensitive information and potentially exploit it. Additionally, this approach makes it difficult to update or rotate the hardcoded values, which is essential for maintaining security.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to externalize sensitive information like the hardcoded IP addresses into a secure configuration file or environment variables. This approach will ensure that the sensitive information is not exposed through the code and can be updated or rotated easily. 

The code can be modified as follows to achieve this:

```verilog
// Define IP addresses in a configuration file or as environment variables
parameter addr_auth_1 = 32'hF00;
parameter addr_auth_2 = 32'h800F00;

assign addr_auth = (address == addr_auth_1 || address == addr_auth_2) ? 1: 0;
```

OR

```verilog
// Load IP addresses from configuration file or environment variables
parameter addr_auth_1 = `ADDR_AUTH_1;
parameter addr_auth_2 = `ADDR_AUTH_2;

assign addr_auth = (address == addr_auth_1 || address == addr_auth_2) ? 1: 0;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00 || address == 32'h800F00) ? 1: 0;
