VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal and Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code is vulnerable to Directory Traversal and Path Traversal vulnerabilities. The code uses user input (`param("user")`) directly in the file path without proper validation and sanitization. This can be exploited by an attacker to access and read arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to information disclosure or other more severe vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `$username` variable is not validated to prevent directory traversal sequences such as `../`. An attacker could provide a specially crafted username that allows them to escape the intended directory and access files outside the intended path.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `$username` variable before using it in the file path. Here are some recommendations:

* Validate the `$username` variable to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not contain directory traversal sequences.
* Use a more secure method of storing and retrieving user profiles, such as storing the profile data in a database rather than in files on the file system.
* Use a secure coding practice such as using a constant for the base directory path and only allowing a specific subset of characters in the username.

```perl
# Example of validation and sanitization
my $username = param("user");
$username =~ s/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/_/g;  # Only allow alphanumeric and underscore characters

my $profilePath = "/users/cwe/profiles/" . $username;
open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $dataPath = "/users/cwe/profiles";
my $username = param("user");
my $profilePath = $dataPath . "/" . $username;
open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");
print "<ul>\n";
while (<$fh>) {
    print "<li>$_</li>\n";
}
print "</ul>\n";
```
