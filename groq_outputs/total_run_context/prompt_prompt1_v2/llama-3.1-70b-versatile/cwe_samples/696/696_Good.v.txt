VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials in the code, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in lines 7-9, where the code compares the `usr_id` with a hardcoded value `3'h4`. If the comparison matches, it sets `grant_access` to 1. This suggests that the code is using a hardcoded username or identifier to grant access, which can be a serious security vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by figuring out the hardcoded value, gaining unauthorized access to the system. Such hardcoded values should ideally be replaced with a more secure authentication mechanism.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove hardcoded credentials and use a secure authentication mechanism instead.
- Consider using a database to store user credentials and validate them against input.
- Ensure that authentication logic is not present in multiple places; extract it into a separate module for better security.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	(always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
       			begin
			    
				  if (!rst_n)
				  
					data_out = 0;
				  
				  else
				  
					assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
					data_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;
				  
			    
			    end
       			endmodule
