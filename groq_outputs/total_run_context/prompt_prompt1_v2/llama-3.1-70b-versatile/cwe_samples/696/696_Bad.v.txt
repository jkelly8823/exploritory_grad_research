VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Unintentional information exposure through synchronous reset logic and improper use of blocking assignments.

EXPLANATION: 
In this module, the `data_out` signal's value is updated both conditionally (using blocking assignment `=`) and unconditionally (using a continuous assignment `assign`). This can lead to unintended information exposure. When the module is reset (`rst_n` goes low), the `data_out` is cleared. However, immediately after reset (`rst_n` goes high), the value of `data_out` is still be driven by its old value until an update from the data bus (data_in). Also, the assignment of `grant_access` using the `=` operator in an always block could potentially cause race conditions if multiple signals drive the signal `grant_access`.

Moreover, by combining the reset logic with a synchronous IF statement and the use of these assignments in an always block, unintended updates or exposure of data can occur due to the handling of clocking logic (`posedge clk or negedge rst_n`). The blocking assignments used here (e.g. `data_out = ...`) could potentially cause unintended information exposure through faulty asynchronous logic if multiple signals drive the signals driving these conditions.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

- Separate the initial reset condition (`!rst_n`) logic and use non-blocking assignments for combinational logic (`data_out <= data_in`) and for synchronous updates as well. 
- Ensure the combinational logic updates (`always @ (usr_id, data_in)`) drives  `grant_access` properly. Don't assign both conditionally and unconditionally.
- Make clear distinctions between resets, updates and holding output through clock pulse (`posedge clk`).

ORIGINAL CODE:
       			module foo_bar(data_out, usr_id, data_in, clk, rst_n);
       			output reg [7:0] data_out;
       			input wire [2:0] usr_id;
       			input wire [7:0] data_in; 
       			input wire clk, rst_n;
       			wire grant_access;
       			always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
       			begin
       			
				  if (!rst_n)
				  
					data_out = 0;
				  
				  else
				  
					data_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;
					assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
				  
			    
			    end
