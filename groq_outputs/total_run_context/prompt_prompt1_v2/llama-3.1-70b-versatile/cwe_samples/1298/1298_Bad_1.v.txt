VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a portion of a SystemVerilog module, and it appears to be implementing a Physical Memory Protection (PMP) module in an RISC-V system. The code sets up a PMP instance with a configuration and input signals. The analysis did not find any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, insecure deserialization, or SQL injection. The code also seems to follow good programming practices, using reset signals and valid signals to control the logic flow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, the code appears to be well-structured and secure.
