VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Arbitrary Command Execution vulnerability using Runtime.getRuntime().exec().

EXPLANATION:
The code uses System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make") to execute system commands. The use of Runtime.exec() to execute commands can pose a security risk, especially when using dynamic or user-provided input, as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands. Although in this case, the command is hardcoded to "make", it is generally discouraged to use Runtime.exec() for executing system commands due to the security implications.

However, considering that the command "make" is hardcoded and does not appear to directly contain any user-provided data, the risk of this vulnerability might be lower. Still, it is generally considered better practice to avoid Runtime.exec() whenever possible, as future modifications or uses in different contexts might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider using a more secure method of executing system commands, such as using the ProcessBuilder class, which can handle redirection and execution in a safer manner. If using Runtime.exec(), ensure that any input that might be eventually passed to the exec() method comes from trusted sources.

Additionally, using a security-focused static analysis tool to monitor the code for potential arbitrary command execution vulnerabilities can help catch any potential issues that might be introduced in the future.
