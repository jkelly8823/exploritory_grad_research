VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `ExecuteGitCommand` function is vulnerable to Command Injection attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The `ExecuteGitCommand` function creates a new command using the `exec.Command` function, passing in user-supplied input (`name` and `arg`) as arguments. However, the `exec.LookPath` function is used to resolve the path to the executable, which can potentially lead to command injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. If an attacker is able to control the value of `name`, they may be able to inject malicious commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to whitelist the allowed commands and validate the input `name` against this whitelist. Additionally, it is recommended to use the `exec.LookPath` function with caution and only use it when absolutely necessary. It is also recommended to use a more secure alternative, such as using a well-known path to the executable, or using a command execution function that allows for better control over the executed command.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```go
func ExecuteGitCommand(name string, arg []string) error {
    c := exec.Command(name, arg...)
    var err error
    c.Path, err = exec.LookPath(name)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
}
```
