VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a missing argument attack, and also exhibits undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The code defines a function `foo_funct` that takes three `int` arguments, but only two arguments are provided when calling the function. This will result in undefined behavior because the third argument is not provided. Furthermore, in C/C++, when a function is called with fewer arguments than the number of parameters it is defined with, the extra parameters are undefined. 

In this specific case, since the function is defined after it is called, and no prototype is given, this code is also subject to implicit int return and parameter types if compiling as C. The printf may try to interpret this unknown value for the 3rd parameter.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should either modify the function `foo_funct` to take two arguments instead of three, or modify the function call to include the missing third argument. Additionally it would be beneficial for the function to be declared (or defined) before its use.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  foo_funct(one, two);
                     void foo_funct(int one, int two, int three) {printf("1) %d\n2) %d\n3) %d\n", one, two, three);}
