VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Secret
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals a hardcoded secret key in the HMAC module. The key is used to authenticate data but is exposed in the code. This undermines the security of the HMAC authentication process, allowing an attacker to obtain the secret key and potentially manipulate the data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Load the key from a secure source**: Instead of hardcoding the key in the code, consider loading it from a secure environment variable, a hardware security module (HSM), or a secure key storage solution.
2. **Use a secure key exchange protocol**: If the key is used to authenticate data exchanged between multiple systems, consider implementing a secure key exchange protocol, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) or RSA key exchange.
3. **Store the key securely**: Ensure that the key is stored securely on the system, using tools like encrypted storage or a secrets manager.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```ruby

if(exp_hash == pass_hash) begin
pass_check = 1'b1;
end else begin
pass_check = 1'b0;
end
state_d = Idle;
end
else begin
state_d = PassChkValid;
end
