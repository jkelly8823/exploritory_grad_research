VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection due to the use of the 'system' function with user-input data.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the 'system' function to execute a command on the shell, passing user-input data ($phone) as a parameter. The input is validated to match a certain pattern, but it is not sanitized or escaped. If the pattern check is bypassed, an attacker could inject malicious commands by manipulating the phone number input. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive data or disrupt system functionality.

In addition, the validation pattern is insufficient to prevent command injection attacks. A more comprehensive validation and sanitization approach should be used to prevent such attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the 'system' function whenever possible, especially with user-input data. Instead, consider using safer alternatives like 'exec' with a predefined list of allowed commands.

2. Validate and sanitize the input data before passing it to the 'system' function. Use a more comprehensive validation pattern to ensure that only valid phone numbers are accepted.

3. Use a parameterized way to pass arguments to the external command. This can help prevent command injection attacks by ensuring that arguments are not treated as part of the command.

4. Use escapes for metacharacters to prevent injection attacks. In this case, ensure that the phone number does not contain any special characters that could be interpreted as commands.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
$phone = GetPhoneNumber();if ($phone =~ /\d+-\d+/) {
    # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
    system("lookup-phone $phone");}
else {error("malformed number!");}
```
