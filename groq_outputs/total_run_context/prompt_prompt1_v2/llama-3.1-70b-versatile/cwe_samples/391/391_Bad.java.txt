VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code catches an exception but does not perform any meaningful action with the caught exception. It simply contains a comment stating that this can never happen, but this ignores the fact that an exception was thrown and caught.

EXPLANATION:
Although the comment claims that this can never happen, the fact that an exception was thrown and caught means that the state of the program is potentially invalid or consistent. Ignoring an exception in this fashion can lead to bug discovery issues down the line. Instead, the caught exception should be logged, re-thrown, or used to recover to a valid state.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Re-throw the exception if no meaningful recovery can be done from it. This helps to promote correct error handling in the calling method.
- Log the exception, even if it is considered rare, in order to assist with debugging and troubleshooting.
- Make sure to check the method doing the exchange to see why the exception was thrown. If possible, fix the cause of the exception.

ORIGINAL CODE:
try {doExchange();}catch (RareException e) {
    // this can never happen
}
