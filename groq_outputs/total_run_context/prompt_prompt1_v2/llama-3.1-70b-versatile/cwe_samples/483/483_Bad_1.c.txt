VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a potential issue where the semicolon (;) is missing after the if condition, causing the Do_X() function to be executed only when the condition is true, while Do_Y() will be executed regardless of the condition.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses an if statement without enclosing the code block in curly brackets. While this may not seem like an issue at first glance, the semicolon after the Do_X() function call can lead to unintended behavior. According to the syntax, the semicolon is treated as the end of the if statement's code block, causing Do_Y() to be executed regardless of the condition. This could potentially introduce logic errors or vulnerabilities in the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this issue, it's recommended to use curly brackets to enclose the code block after the if condition. Here's the corrected code:

```c
if (condition == true) {
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
}
```

Alternatively, if the intention is to only execute Do_X() when the condition is true, and Do_Y() should be executed regardless of the condition, the code can be rewritten with proper indentation to improve readability and avoid confusion:

```c
if (condition == true)
    Do_X();
Do_Y();
```

However, it is still recommended to use curly brackets for the if statement to avoid any potential errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true) Do_X();Do_Y();
