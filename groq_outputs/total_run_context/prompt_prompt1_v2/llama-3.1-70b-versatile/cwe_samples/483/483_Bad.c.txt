VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present is a potential Logic Bug due to the use of multiple statements on the same line after an if statement, without proper bracket usage. This could lead to unpredictable behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows an if statement evaluating a condition. However, after the condition is evaluated to true, the code explicitly calls Do_X() but then calls Do_Y() unconditionally. The problem arises because the intent of the code is not clear. If the intent was to call Do_Y() only when the condition is true, the lack of brackets could lead to unexpected behavior. However, if the intent was to call Do_Y() regardless of the condition, then the placement of Do_Y() on the same line as the if statement is misleading.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this potential vulnerability, we strongly recommend adding brackets to improve code readability and explicitly define the scope of the if statement. Here are two possible fixes depending on the intent of the code:

If the intent was to call Do_Y() only when the condition is true:
```
if (condition) {
  Do_X();
  Do_Y();
}
```
If the intent was to call Do_Y() regardless of the condition:
```
if (condition) {
  Do_X();
}
Do_Y();
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
