VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Use of equals() Method
EXPLANATION:
The use of the equals() method in the isSameAccount() function presents a potential vulnerability. This is because the equals() method may be implemented insecurely or have side effects in the BankAccount class, potentially allowing for issues such as inconsistent state or exposure of sensitive data. Furthermore, if the BankAccount class implements equals() using a non-final method (e.g., a method that can be overridden in a subclass), it may be vulnerable to attacks that rely on creating a malicious subclass.

However, the major concern here is the possibility that the equals() method might throw a NullPointerException if accountA or accountB is null. This can happen if accountA or accountB has not been properly initialized or if the null checking has not been handled elsewhere in the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement null checking before calling the equals() method.
- Ensure that the equals() method in the BankAccount class is implemented securely, does not have side effects, and is symmetric, transitive, and reflexive.
- If the isSameAccount() function is not required to handle subclasses, consider using the == operator to check for exact object equality instead of equals(), which will prevent issues with malicious subclasses.
- Perform additional validation on the account objects if necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public boolean isSameAccount(BankAccount accountA, BankAccount accountB) {return accountA.equals(accountB);}
