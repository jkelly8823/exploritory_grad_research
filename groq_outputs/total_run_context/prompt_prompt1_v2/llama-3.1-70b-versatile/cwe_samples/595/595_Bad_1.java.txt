VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to incorrect object comparison, potentially leading to logical errors or security flaws.
EXPLANATION:
The isSameAccount method is using the == operator to compare two BankAccount objects. However, the == operator in Java compares object references, not the actual values of the objects. This means that even if the two BankAccount objects represent the same account, the method will return false unless they are the exact same object instance. This is not the intended behavior for this method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the method should override the equals method in the BankAccount class to compare the actual values of the objects. Here's an example:

```java
public boolean isSameAccount(BankAccount accountA, BankAccount accountB) {
    return accountA != null ? accountA.equals(accountB) : accountB == null;
}
```

And in the BankAccount class:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj)
        return true;
    if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass())
        return false;
    BankAccount other = (BankAccount) obj;
    return accountNumber == other.accountNumber;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public boolean isSameAccount(BankAccount accountA, BankAccount accountB) {return accountA == accountB;}
```
