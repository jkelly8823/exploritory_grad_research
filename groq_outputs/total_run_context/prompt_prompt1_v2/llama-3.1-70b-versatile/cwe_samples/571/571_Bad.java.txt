Potential Logic Bug: Premature Variable Override
EXPLANATION:
The `isProductAvailable` variable is initially set to `false`. However, in all the branches of the if-else statements within the `updateInventory` function (lines 3-5), `isProductAvailable` is being set to `true`. This could potentially be a logic bug, as the actual availability of the product is not being checked, and the `updateProductDatabase` function is being called regardless of whether the product is truly available or not. This is only the start of the logical issue as further on in the example it is passed as true even if no update is done to a database indicating a product delay.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The logical condition may need to be reviewed and adjusted according to the true requirements of the system. The `isProductAvailable` variable should only be set to `true` if the product is indeed available. Ensure that this variable is set to its correct value in each branch to prevent incorrect database updates. Review the use of `productInStore` and `productInWarehouse` methods to ensure that they are correctly determining the availability of the product. Also remove setting it to true in else section so that logic of delayed or available works smoothly.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public void updateInventory(String productNumber) {
    boolean isProductAvailable = false;
    boolean isDelayed = false;
    if (productInStore(productNumber)) {
        isProductAvailable = true;
        updateInStoreDatabase(productNumber);
    } else if (productInWarehouse(productNumber)) {
        isProductAvailable = true;
        updateInWarehouseDatabase(productNumber);
    } else {
        isProductAvailable = true;
    }
    if (isProductAvailable) {
        updateProductDatabase(productNumber);
    } else if (isDelayed) {
        /* Warn customer about delay before order processing */
        ...
    }
}
