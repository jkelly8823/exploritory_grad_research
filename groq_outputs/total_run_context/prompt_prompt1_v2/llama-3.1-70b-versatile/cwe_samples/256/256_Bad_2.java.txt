VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Sensitive Information.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a ResourceBundle properties file for a Java web application. However, the properties file contains sensitive information, such as an LDAP username and password, in plain text. Hardcoding sensitive information directly into the codebase is a significant security risk, as it can be accessed by unauthorized users, potentially leading to security breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to store sensitive information securely using environment variables, a secrets manager, or a configuration file that is not committed to version control. This way, sensitive data is not exposed in the codebase, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Here are possible alternatives:

* Use environment variables or a secrets manager to store sensitive information.
* Implement a configuration file that is not committed to version control, using a secure storage solution.
* Use a secure external storage solution, such as a HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
