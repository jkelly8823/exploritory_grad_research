VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials in plain text. This is a vulnerability because it allows an attacker with access to the code or configuration file to obtain sensitive information, such as the username and password, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using environment variables or a secure configuration storage mechanism to store sensitive information. Remove hardcoded credentials and instead use a configuration file or database to store sensitive information.

Here are some possible ways to improve this code:

* Use environment variables to store sensitive information.
* Consider using a configuration file that is not stored in the same repository as the code.
* Implement a secure secret management service to store sensitive information.
