VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded password or password retrieval from a file with hardcoded path.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals that it's retrieving a password from a properties file named "config.properties" and then using this password to connect to a database. Hardcoded paths can pose security risks if they are accessible by unauthorized parties. Furthermore, the properties file containing the password might be accessible to attackers, exposing the password. 

Another possible vulnerability in this code is that the password itself might be hardcoded in the properties file. If the properties file is committed to the source control system, this would mean that the password is easily accessible by anyone with access to the repository.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of storing the password in a properties file with a hardcoded path, it's recommended to use environment variables or a secrets manager to store sensitive information. Also, consider encrypting sensitive information when storing it.

Here's an example of how you might use environment variables to store the password:

Properties prop = new Properties();
prop.load(new FileInputStream(System.getenv("CONFIG_FILE_PATH")));
String password = System.getenv("PASSWORD");

or

String password = System.getProperty("password");

Hardcoding the path to the properties file should also be avoided. Instead, consider making it configurable or relative to the application's root directory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 
...Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));String password = prop.getProperty("password");DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);...
