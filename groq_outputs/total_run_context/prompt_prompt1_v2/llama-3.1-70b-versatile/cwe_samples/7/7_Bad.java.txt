VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code has a potential vulnerability related to information disclosure through log output. The Vulnerability is a form of CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises because the catch block of the doPost() method logs the entire ApplicationSpecificException 'ase' using the toString() method. This could potentially allow sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, file paths) to be inadvertently written to the log file. A determined attacker could exploit this information disclosure vulnerability to gain valuable insights into the application's behavior or the underlying system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the logging statement could be modified to only include information that is absolutely necessary and safely output. It is recommended to use a safer logging method that prevents sensitive data from being exposed in logs. An example might be to use logger.error("ApplicationSpecificException caught. Review logs for stacktrace", ase). This logs the fact that an exception was caught and references the exception itself, which would still be recorded with the full stacktrace in the logs, without revealing any sensitive data that may be part of the exception itself.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());}}
```
