VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Insecure Thread Usage

EXPLANATION:
 The issue lies in the fact that the code is calling the `run()` method directly on the thread object. This bypasses the Java threading mechanism and doesn't actually create a new thread. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code unresponsive. 

 Instead, the `start()` method should be called to initialize the new thread and allow it to run concurrently.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, replace `thr.run()` with `thr.start()`. This ensures that a new thread is created and allows the code within the `run()` method to execute concurrently.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Thread thr = new Thread() {public void run() {...}};
thr.run();
```
