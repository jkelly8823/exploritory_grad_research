VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Usage of Non-Synchronized Access to a Shared Counter Variable

EXPLANATION:
This code extends the HttpServlet class and overrides the doGet method. It increments a shared static counter variable 'count' and prints it to the output. However, the counter variable is not thread-safe, and multiple threads can access it simultaneously. This can lead to incorrect counts being displayed as multiple threads may try to increment the counter at the same time. 

In a multi-threaded environment, the threads may interfere with each other's access to the shared variable, resulting in inconsistent results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, it's recommended to use synchronization or atomic integers to ensure thread safety. Here are some possible solutions:

- Use a synchronized block to protect access to the shared counter variable. This approach can impact performance as only one thread can access the counter at a time.

    ```java
synchronized (Counter.class) {
    count++;
}
```

- Use an AtomicInteger which is a thread-safe counter. It uses low-level hardware instructions for better performance and threading.

    ```java
private static AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

// ...

p.println(count.incrementAndGet() + " hits so far!");
```

- Use an EJB or SpringBean managed singleton with its own thread-safe methods.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public static class Counter extends HttpServlet {
    static int count = 0;
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest in, HttpServletResponse out)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
        out.setContentType("text/plain");
        PrintWriter p = out.getWriter();
        count++;
        p.println(count + " hits so far!");
    }
}
```
