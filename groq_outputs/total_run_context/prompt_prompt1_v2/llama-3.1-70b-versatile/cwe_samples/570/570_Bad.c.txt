VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a logic error due to a misuse of bitwise operators. The `&` operator is used instead of the `|` operator when defining the `mask` variable, leading to incorrect permission checking.

EXPLANATION:
The code defines two constants, `BIT_READ` and `BIT_WRITE`, and attempts to create a `mask` variable by performing a bitwise AND operation between these constants. However, the intention is to use the bitwise OR operator `|` to combine the read and write bits. As a result, the `mask` variable is set to 0, causing the `hasReadWriteAccess` function to incorrectly return true or false.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, simply replace the `&` operator with the `|` operator when defining the `mask` variable. This ensures that the `mask` variable correctly represents the combination of read and write bits, allowing the `hasReadWriteAccess` function to accurately determine if a user has read and write access.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
#define BIT_READ 0x0001 // 00000001
#define BIT_WRITE 0x0010 // 00010000
unsigned int mask = BIT_READ & BIT_WRITE; /* intended to use "|" */
// using "&", mask = 00000000
// using "|", mask = 00010001
// determine if user has read and write access
int hasReadWriteAccess(unsigned int userMask) {
    // if the userMask has read and write bits set
    // then return 1 (true)
    if (userMask & mask) {
        return 1;
    }
    // otherwise return 0 (false)
    return 0;
}
```
