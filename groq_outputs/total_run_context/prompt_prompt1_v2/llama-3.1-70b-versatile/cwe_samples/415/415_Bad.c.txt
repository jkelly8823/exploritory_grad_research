VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a potential double-free vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the same pointer is freed twice, which can cause undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if a certain condition is met (`abrt` is true) and then frees the `ptr`. However, regardless of the condition, the code frees the `ptr` again towards the end. If `abrt` is true, this results in a double-free scenario. Double-free can lead to undefined behavior, including but not limited to crashes, data corruption, or potential code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to ensure that the `ptr` is only freed once. This can be achieved by moving the second `free(ptr)` inside the `if` condition to check if it was previously freed in the case of `abrt`. Here is a revised version:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
   free(ptr);
} else {
   free(ptr);
}
```
Alternatively, a flag can be used to track whether the `ptr` has already been freed:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
bool ptr_freed = false;
...
if (abrt) {
   if (!ptr_freed) {
       free(ptr);
       ptr_freed = true;
   }
}
if (!ptr_freed) {
   free(ptr);
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
  
    free(ptr);
  
}
...
free(ptr);
```
