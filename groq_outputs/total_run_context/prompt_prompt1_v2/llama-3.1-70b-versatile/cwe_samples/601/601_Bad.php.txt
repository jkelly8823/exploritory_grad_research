VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unvalidated Redirect Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet retrieves the 'url' parameter from the GET request and directly redirects the user to the specified URL without any validation. This could lead to an attacker redirecting users to a malicious website, potentially resulting in phishing attacks or further exploitation. This type of vulnerability allows attackers to control the redirect location.

The HTTP Location header is used to redirect the user to the $redirect_url. If an attacker injects a malicious URL in the 'url' parameter, they can control the redirect location, potentially hijacking user sessions or executing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the 'url' parameter to ensure it is an internal URL and within an allowed domain.
- Enable Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the websites that can be redirected to.
- Use the 'http://' prefix and verify that the redirect URL is within the expected domain before proceeding.
- Implement a whitelist of allowed redirect URLs or a formalized redirect validation mechanism.
- Consider using a 302 or 303 status code instead of using the Location header.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$redirect_url = $_GET['url'];
header("Location: " . $redirect_url);
