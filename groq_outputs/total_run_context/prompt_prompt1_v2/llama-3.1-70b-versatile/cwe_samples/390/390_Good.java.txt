VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insufficient Error Handling and Insecure File Reading

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet has several vulnerabilities and best practice issues. 

1.  Insecure file reading: The code uses `FileReader` to read a file specified by a filename. This can lead to a file path traversal vulnerability if the filename is user-controlled and not properly sanitized. An attacker could provide a filename that traverses the directory structure to a sensitive file.

2.  Resource management: The `FileReader` object is not closed in a finally block, which means it might not be closed if an exception occurs. This can lead to resource leaks.

3.  Insufficient error handling: The code catches `Exception` and then re-throws it as a new `Exception`. This can lead to loss of information about the original exception. It's generally better to handle specific exceptions instead of the general `Exception` class.

4.  Insecure exception handling: The code catches `FileNotFoundException` and re-throws it as a new `FileNotFoundException`. However, the original exception's cause and stack trace are lost in this process. It's better to re-throw the original exception or create a new one with the original exception as its cause.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Use `Files.readAllBytes()` from Java 7 onwards to read the entire file in one go. It's more efficient and safer.
2.  Use a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure the `FileReader` object is closed properly.
3.  Avoid catching the general `Exception` class. Instead, handle specific exceptions that might occur during file reading.
4.  Avoid re-throwing exceptions as new ones. Instead, re-throw the original exception or create a new one with the original exception as its cause.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public String readFile(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, Exception {
    String retString = null;
    try {
        // initialize File and FileReader objects
        File file = new File(filename);
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
        // initialize character buffer
        long fLen = file.length();
        char[] cBuf = new char[(int) fLen];
        // read data from file
        int iRead = fr.read(cBuf, 0, (int) fLen);
        // close file
        fr.close();
        retString = new String(cBuf);
    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
        System.err.println("Error: FileNotFoundException opening the input file: " + filename);
        System.err.println("" + ex.getMessage());
        throw new FileNotFoundException(ex.getMessage());
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        System.err.println("Error: IOException reading the input file.\n" + ex.getMessage());
        throw new IOException(ex);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        System.err.println("Error: Exception reading the input file.\n" + ex.getMessage());
        throw new Exception(ex);
    }
    return retString;
}
