VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Plaintext Password Transmission and Lack of Error Handling for Socket Operations.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet sends a username and password to a server over a socket connection. This is a potential vulnerability, as it transmits sensitive authentication information in plaintext. Furthermore, the code snippet does not handle errors that may occur during socket operations, such as socket connection failures or timeouts.

Additionally, the code snippet does not check for socket disconnections before sending data. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the server disconnects unexpectedly.

The line `writeSocket($sock, "AUTH $username $password\n");` is particularly concerning, as it directly transmits the password to the server in plaintext. Similarly, the line `writeSocket($sock, "CHANGE-ADDRESS $username $address\n";` sends sensitive information over the socket without proper error handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider using a secure socket (TLS or SSL) to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server. This will protect sensitive authentication information from being intercepted.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection and buffer overflows.
3. Implement proper error handling for socket operations to prevent unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
4. Store and transmit passwords securely, using techniques such as salted hashing and secure key exchange protocols.
5. Always validate the server's identity before transmitting sensitive information to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
$server = "server.example.com";
$username = AskForUserName();
$password = AskForPassword();
$address = AskForAddress();
$sock = OpenSocket($server, 1234);
writeSocket($sock, "AUTH $username $password\n");
$resp = readSocket($sock);
if ($resp eq "success") {
                           
    # username/pass is valid, go ahead and update the info!
    writeSocket($sock, "CHANGE-ADDRESS $username $address\n";
}else {
    print "ERROR: Invalid Authentication!\n";
}
