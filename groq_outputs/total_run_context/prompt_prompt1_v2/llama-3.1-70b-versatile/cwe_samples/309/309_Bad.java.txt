VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and potential hash collision attacks, but primarily vulnerable due to it not actually using the digest of the plainText variable to perform comparisons with the expected stored hash. Instead, it uses the digest of the password, which has not been defined in this snippet. 
EXPLANATION:
The primary issue here lies in the fact that the password digest is being compared to the expected stored hash, not the hash of the plaintext provided by the user. Since password has not been defined in this snippet, we are assuming it has been previously defined as the variable associated with "encer" for analysis' sake; though that is speculation. This creates a vulnerability by making it difficult to guarantee the integrity of the program's authentication mechanism. 
Additional to this, due to "SHA" being an insecure hashing algorithm due to its potential for collisions, you may wish to use a more secure hash like SHA3 or Argon2. Then, add salting and a pepper. On a related note, when comparing digests, use a constant-time comparison like Java's 'java.util.Arrays.equals()' to prevent a timing attack, as such attacks could potentially be used to access a user's hash and ultimately access the password. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace line 3 with `byte[] digest = encer.digest();`. Update line 7 to use `java.util.Arrays.equals(digest,secret_password())` to compare digests securely. As an update also introduce secure hashing algorithms ("SHA-256" and "SHA-3" recommended) and consider adding hashing salt to improve security further.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
                     //Login if hash matches stored hash
                     if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}
