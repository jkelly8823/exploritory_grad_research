VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability and Hard-Coded Key Exposure.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet indicates that when `debug_mode_i` is set to true, both `key_big0` and `key_big1` are assigned a hard-coded zero value. This is a clear example of hard-coded key exposure which should be treated as sensitive information. It could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Furthermore, the way `key_big` is assigned based on `key_sel[0]` and `key_sel[1]` is similar to IDOR, where an authenticated user might be able to access unauthorized information. 

Additionally, since `debug_mode_i` directly affects the assignment of `key_big0` and `key_big1`, it seems that `debug_mode_i` might be directly controllable by an attacker if it is publicly exposed. In that case, if an attacker can set `debug_mode_i` to true and then access the sensitive key, this becomes a significant vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid hard-coding keys or any other sensitive data directly within the code. Consider using an external secure key management system or environment variables to manage sensitive keys.
2. Implement proper authorization checks for accessing sensitive information or performing debugging actions. 
3. Never expose debug mode and secure keys control to untrusted users.
4. Use more secure methods for generating and handling sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
assign key_big0    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key0[0],
key0[1], key0[2], key0[3], key0[4], key0[5]};
assign key_big1    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key1[0],
key1[1], key1[2], key1[3], key1[4], key1[5]};
assign key_big2    = {key2[0], key2[1], key2[2],
key2[3], key2[4], key2[5]};
assign key_big = key_sel[1] ? key_big2 : ( key_sel[0] ?
key_big1 : key_big0 );
