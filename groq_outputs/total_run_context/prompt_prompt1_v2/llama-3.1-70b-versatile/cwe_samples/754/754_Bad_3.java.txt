VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to Potential Information Disclosure, which can reveal the operating system being used by the application.
EXPLANATION:
The `System.clearProperty("os.name")` call is likely being used to remove any existing value for the "os.name" property. However, it is immediately followed by `String os = System.getProperty("os.name")`, which retrieves the current value of the "os.name" property. Since the previous line cleared this property, the result is that the current operating system's name will be retrieved from the underlying system. This can potentially allow an attacker to determine the type of operating system the application is running on. While it might seem innocent to determine the operating system type from an attack perspective, this information can be useful as part of reconnaissance for targeted system-specific attacks.

Moreover, checking for "Windows 95" and displaying a "Not supported" message raises additional concerns, as it might reveal outdated code and allow an attacker to tailor their attack accordingly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Avoid directly retrieving the operating system's name using `System.getProperty("os.name")`. If possible, consider storing the supported operating systems in a configuration or properties file instead of hardcoding them. Also, handle operating system type more securely and limit information disclosure.

If a line has to be used to check the version, then check against a series of supported platforms rather than unsupported ones. Ensure any such platforms-specific checking involves secure coding practices.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
System.clearProperty("os.name");...String os = System.getProperty("os.name");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase("Windows 95")) System.out.println("Not supported");
