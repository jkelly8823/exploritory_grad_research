VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Remote Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerability via Equal Comparison of User-Controlled Data
EXPLANATION:
The line `itemName.Equals(IMPORTANT_ITEM)` uses the `Equals` method to compare the `itemName` string, which originates from an external source (`request.Item(ITEM_NAME)`), with a specific value (`IMPORTANT_ITEM`). This comparison can lead to a potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability if an attacker provides a specially crafted input, such as a large string or a string that causes the comparison to loop indefinitely. The impact of such an attack could be significant, as it could cause the application to become unresponsive or even crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more secure comparison method that does not rely on the `Equals` method, such as using `String.Compare` with a comparison ordinal. Additionally, ensure that any user-provided input is validated and sanitized before being used in the comparison.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String itemName = request.Item(ITEM_NAME);if (itemName.Equals(IMPORTANT_ITEM)) {...}...
