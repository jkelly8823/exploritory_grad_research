VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability due to unbounded use of fgets and strcpy.
EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. Although fgets is used, which prevents a buffer overflow due to the specified maximum bytes to read, the maximum bytes to read is hardcoded to 10. However, this safeguard can be rendered useless if user input exceeds the capacity of the input buffer. Furthermore, the subsequent strcpy operation doesn't prevent a buffer overflow either if the input data copied to cp_buf exceeds the capacity of cp_buf. In order to guard against this attack, the destination buffer should be checked for overflow conditions prior to the copy operation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can replace strcpy with a safer function such as strncpy:

strncpy(cp_buf, buf, sizeof(cp_buf) - 1);
cp_buf[sizeof(cp_buf) - 1] = '\0';

Also consider using more modern standard library functions, which provide safer alternatives to strcpy and fgets:

Instead of fgets you can use:
fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf) - 1, stdin);
buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';

You can also consider dynamically checking the length of the data before the copy operation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char buf[10], cp_buf[10];fgets(buf, 10, stdin);strcpy(cp_buf, buf);
