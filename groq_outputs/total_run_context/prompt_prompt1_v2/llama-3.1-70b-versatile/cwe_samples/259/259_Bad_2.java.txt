VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Sensitive Information

EXPLANATION:
I have detected that sensitive information, specifically LDAP username and password, is hardcoded directly into the ResourceBundle properties file. This presents a significant security risk as hardcoded credentials can be easily accessed by anyone with access to the file. It is essential to keep such sensitive information confidential and secure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use Environment Variables**: Instead of hardcoding the LDAP username and password, use environment variables to store them securely. This way, the sensitive information is not stored directly in the code.
2. **Store Credentials Securely**: Consider using a secure secrets manager or a vault to store sensitive information like credentials. This provides a more secure and manageable way to handle sensitive data.
3. **Use Secure Configuration Files**: Use a secure configuration file that encrypts sensitive information, making it harder for unauthorized access.
4. **Do Not Commit Sensitive Information**: Ensure that sensitive information is not committed to version control systems like GitHub. Use a .gitignore file to ignore sensitive files.
