VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Hardcoded Credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The segment of code provided hardcodes database connection credentials ("scott" and "tiger") directly into the code. Hardcoding credentials is a serious security vulnerability as it poses a significant risk of unauthorized access to the database. An attacker who has access to the code can easily obtain the login credentials and access sensitive data. The hardcoded credentials are also not secured or encrypted in any way, making it easier for an attacker to exploit them.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To remediate this vulnerability, it is recommended to replace hardcoded credentials with secure alternatives. This can be done by:

1. Using environment variables: Store the credentials as environment variables that can be passed to the application without hardcoding them in the code.
2. Implementing a secrets manager: Use a secrets manager like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve credentials.
3. Using a secure configuration file: Store the credentials in a secure configuration file that is not committed to the source code repository.

ORIGINAL CODE:
DriverManager.getConnection(url, "scott", "tiger");
