VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
This method, `VerifyAdmin`, takes a password as input and checks it against a hardcoded string. This hardcoded string appears to be an MD5 hash of the actual password. Hardcoding credentials can pose a significant security risk as it makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access. In this case, an attacker only needs to know the hashed password value ("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b") to access the system in diagnostic mode.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the hardcoded credentials should be replaced with a secure password storage and verification mechanism. This could include:
1. Storing the hashed password in a secure location, such as an environment variable or a secrets management system.
2. Using a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
3. Comparing the input password with the stored hashed password using a secure comparison function to prevent timing attacks.
4. Implementing password policies to enforce strong passwords.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public boolean VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.equals("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {System.out.println("Entering Diagnostic Mode...");return true;}System.out.println("Incorrect Password!");return false;
