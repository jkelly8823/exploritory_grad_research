VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow and Out-of-Bounds Array Access

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses array indexing with dynamically computed indices (addr_i and raddr_q). The indexing is not validated against the array bounds, which could lead to buffer overflows and out-of-bounds array accesses. The fact that `raddr_q` is assigned a value based on `addr_i` and used later to access the `mem` array means that exploiting the issue with `addr_i` could potentially lead to writing outside the bounds of `mem`.

Additionally, in the line `rdata_o = (raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;`, the check is done with `raddr_q < RomSize`, which is only preventing accesses to an invalid index if `RomSize` is less than 0. The upper bound of the `mem` array, however, is not checked.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these issues:

*   Validate `addr_i` against the bounds of the `mem` array before using it to assign a value to `raddr_q`.
*   Validate `raddr_q` against the bounds of the `mem` array before using it to access the `mem` array in both assignments.

Example:

```SystemVerilog
always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
    if (req_i) begin
        if (!we_i) begin
            if (addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3] >= 0 && addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3] < RomSize) begin
                raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3];
            end else begin
                // handle error or invalid address
            end
        end else begin
            if (addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3] >= 0 && addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3] < RomSize) begin
                mem[addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3]] <= wdata_i;
            end else begin
                // handle error or invalid address
            end
        end
    end
end
```

And:

```SystemVerilog
assign rdata_o = (raddr_q >= 0 && raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```SystemVerilog
always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
    if (req_i) begin
        if (!we_i) begin
            raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3];
        end else begin
            mem[addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3]] <= wdata_i;
        end
    end
end

// this prevents spurious Xes from propagating into the speculative fetch stage of the core

assign rdata_o = (raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;
```
