VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a vulnerability related to exception handling and potential information disclosure. It catches a general Exception and logs it, which may reveal sensitive information about the system, database connection, or other internal workings.

EXPLANATION:
The try-catch block attempts to establish a database connection using the DriverManager.getConnection method. If an exception occurs, it catches the exception and logs it. However, logging exceptions can potentially reveal sensitive information, such as database connection strings, usernames, and passwords. An attacker could exploit this information to gain unauthorized access to the system or database.

Additionally, catching the general Exception class can mask important information about the error, making it more difficult to debug and diagnose issues. This approach may also lead to an attacker discovering more about the system's internal workings than intended.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Catch specific exceptions: Instead of catching the general Exception class, catch specific exceptions that may occur during database connections, such as SQLException. This approach will help prevent sensitive information from being logged.
2. Log at the correct severity level: Log exceptions at a suitable severity level (e.g., error or warning) to ensure that they are properly escalated to the development team for investigation and repair.
3. Avoid logging sensitive information: Remove or sanitize any sensitive information from the exception message or additional data before logging it. Consider using a logging framework that supports filtering sensitive data.
4. Implement additional error handling: Consider implementing additional error handling mechanisms, such as retrying failed connections or defaulting to a secure configuration, to handle exceptions more robustly.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}
catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}
