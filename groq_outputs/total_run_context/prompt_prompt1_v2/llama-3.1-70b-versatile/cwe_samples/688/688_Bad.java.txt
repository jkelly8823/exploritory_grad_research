VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The provided code snippet contains a method signature with a conflicting return type `private boolean void` and does not properly validate the user's roles. The return type should be either `boolean` or `void`, but not both. Furthermore, it calls itself recursively without a base case which can lead to a StackOverflowError.

EXPLANATION:
Upon analyzing the provided code, there are two main issues. The first issue is the conflicting return type in the method signature `public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user)`. In Java, a method can only have one return type. Therefore, it should be either `public boolean` or `public void`. 

The second issue is that the method `accessGranted(String resource, String user)` calls `accessGranted(resource, ADMIN_ROLES)` without proper validation of user roles. If the method `accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles)` has a recursive call to itself or it contains a loop with insufficient condition to exit, this will lead to a StackOverflowError.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Correct the return type in the method signature to either `public boolean` or `public void` depending on the intended functionality.
2. Implement a proper base case in the recursive call to avoid a StackOverflowError. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...;public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user) {String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user);return accessGranted(resource, ADMIN_ROLES);}
private boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {
    // grant or deny access based on user roles
    ...
}
