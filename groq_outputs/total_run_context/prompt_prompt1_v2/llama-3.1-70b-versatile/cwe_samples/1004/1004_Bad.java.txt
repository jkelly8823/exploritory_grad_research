VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Generation and Storage of Session ID

EXPLANATION:
The code generates a session ID and sets it as a cookie in the user's browser. However, the generation method `generateSessionId()` is not shown in this code snippet, and it is not clear if it uses a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). Furthermore, the session ID is stored in plain text, without any additional security measures such as secure attribute or HTTP-only flag.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the `generateSessionId()` method uses a CSPRNG, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`.
2. Set the secure attribute on the session ID cookie to prevent it from being transmitted over an insecure connection.
3. Set the HTTP-only attribute on the session ID cookie to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
4. Consider using a more secure method of session management, such as storing the session ID on the server-side and using a token-based authentication system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
response.addCookie(c);
