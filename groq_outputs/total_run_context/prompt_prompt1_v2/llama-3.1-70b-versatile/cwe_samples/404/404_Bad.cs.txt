VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. SQL injection occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious SQL code into a web application's database in order to extract or modify sensitive data.

EXPLANATION:
The potential vulnerability is located on lines 3 and 6. The 'queryString' variable is directly passed to the SqlCommand without any sanitization or validation. If 'queryString' is built based on user input, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database. The connection opening and reader execution steps on lines 3 and 6, respectively, execute the malicious query. Additionally, exception handling is missing which might lead to crash or unexpected behavior in case of an exception.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Parameterize queries:**  Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. An example of how to parameterize queries using ADO.NET is shown below. 
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = @name");
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", queryString);

2. **Use stored procedures:**  If the SQL query is complex, consider using stored procedures to protect against SQL injection.

3. **Implement proper exception handling:** Add proper exception handling to ensure that in case of an exception, the connection is closed and any further actions are taken according to your application's requirements. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);
cmd.Connection = conn;
conn.Open();
SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
HarvestResults(rdr);
conn.Close();
