Resource Leak Vulnerability and Potential SQL Injection

EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet is vulnerable to a resource leak and potential SQL injection. In the try block, a Connection object is created, but it is not closed in a finally block or within the try block, since it may be thrown away by the exception. This can lead to resource leaks if an exception is thrown, as the connection will never be closed.

Additionally, the string "some_connection_string" is not sanitized, and its origin is unknown. If this string comes from an untrusted source, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, the Connection object should be closed in a finally block to ensure that it is always closed, even if an exception occurs. Additionally, the connection string should be sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection. 

Use a try-with-resources statement, which automatically closes the Connection object, even if an exception occurs. 

```java
try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(sanitized_connection_string)) {
    // Use the connection here
} catch (Exception e) {
    log(e);
}
```
Also, ensure that "sanitized_connection_string" does not come from an untrusted source and follows the recommended way of constructing SQL queries using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```
try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}
```
