VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Mismatched memory deallocation.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the memory was allocated using `malloc()`, which is a C-style dynamic memory allocation function, but it is being deallocated using `delete`, which is a C++-style deallocation operator. This is problematic because `delete` does not know how to properly deallocate memory allocated with `malloc()`. 

In C++, memory allocated with `new` should be deallocated with `delete`, and memory allocated with `malloc()` should be deallocated with `free()`. Mixing the two can result in undefined behavior, including memory leaks or crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix for this issue is to use the correct deallocation operator for the allocation method used. In this case, since `malloc()` is being used to allocate memory, the memory should be deallocated using `free()`.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));free(ptr);}
```

Alternatively, if you are programming in C++ and are using C++11 or later, you should consider using smart pointers or container classes instead of manual memory management with `new`, `delete`, `malloc()`, and `free()`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));delete ptr;}
```
