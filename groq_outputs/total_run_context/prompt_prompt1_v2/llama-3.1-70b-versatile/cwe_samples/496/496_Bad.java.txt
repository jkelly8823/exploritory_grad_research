VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to potential data exposure with untrusted input.
EXPLANATION:
The setUserRoles method does not check for null before setting the userRoles attribute. This attribute is then potentially accessible by other methods within the class. Furthermore, the method accepts a mutable array. Since the array is mutable and was not copied before being assigned to the class attribute, modifications to the array outside the class can introduce unexpected behavior or potentially expose sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, it is recommended to add null checks before setting the attribute and to make a defensive copy of the input array. A defensive copy is one that cannot be modified from outside the class.

```java
public void setUserRoles(String[] userRoles) {
    if (userRoles != null) {
        this.userRoles = Arrays.copyOf(userRoles, userRoles.length);
    } else {
        this.userRoles = new String[0];
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
private String[] userRoles;
public void setUserRoles(String[] userRoles) {this.userRoles = userRoles;}
