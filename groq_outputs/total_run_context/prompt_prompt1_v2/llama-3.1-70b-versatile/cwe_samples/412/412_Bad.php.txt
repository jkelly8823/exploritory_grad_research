VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal and Potential Resource Leak Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the way it handles file operations. The most significant concern is that the variable $logfile is not checked for FALSE after attempting to open the file. If fopen() fails to open the file, it will return FALSE, which is not handled, and subsequent operations will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, the fclose() function is called on $logFile (with a capital F) which is undefined.

Another point of concern is that the file name "logFile.log" is hardcoded and can potentially be exploited through a Path Traversal attack if this code is modified to accept filename input in the future.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Always check the return value of fopen() and fclose() for potential errors. Handle them accordingly to prevent undefined behavior. It is also recommended to use a try-catch block for this purpose. The fclose() function should be called on the correct variable $logfile, not $logFile. Additionally, ensure that the log file path is properly validated and escaped to prevent Path Traversal attacks. 

Consider using more secure and modern file handling functions such as spl_file_object.

ORIGINAL CODE:
function writeToLog($message){$logfile = fopen("logFile.log", "a");
                        //attempt to get logfile lock
                        if (flock($logfile, LOCK_EX)) {fwrite($logfile,$message);
                           // unlock logfile
                           flock($logfile, LOCK_UN);}else {print "Could not obtain logFile.log message not recorded\n";}}fclose($logFile);
