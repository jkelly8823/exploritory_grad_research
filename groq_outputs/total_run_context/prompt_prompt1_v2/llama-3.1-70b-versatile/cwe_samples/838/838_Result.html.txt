VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains an XSS vulnerability in the `onload` event handler of the `img` tag. The `onload` event is triggered when the image is loaded, and it executes the JavaScript code `alert(document.cookie)`, which outputs the user's cookies. This is a security risk as an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can steal sensitive user data. The use of inline scripts and event handlers is a common way to introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this XSS vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. Avoid using inline scripts and event handlers. Instead, use external JavaScript files and attach event listeners to DOM elements programmatically.
2. Validate and sanitize any user-input data to prevent malicious code injection.
3. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and define a set of allowed sources for scripts.
4. If the alert is necessary, use a more secure approach, such as concatenating a static string with a trusted value.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  <img src='pic.jpg' alt='altTextHere' onload='alert(document.cookie)' />
