VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Inconsistent null check with synchronized block.
EXPLANATION:
The given code uses a double-checked locking pattern to lazily initialize the `helper` object. However, the null check is performed outside of the synchronized block and then again inside the synchronized block. While this pattern can be an optimized way to reduce synchronization overhead for performance-critical code, it can pose issues if not implemented correctly. Specifically, this code snippet may be vulnerable on platforms where the Java Memory Model permits out-of-order execution of instructions and visibility of partially constructed objects.

The problem is that another thread might see the `helper` object before it is fully initialized, as the assignment of the `helper` reference and the initialization of the `Helper` object are separate operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including potential crashes or incorrect results, when other threads try to use the not-yet-initialized `helper` object.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid this vulnerability, the recommended fix is to use one of the following approaches:

1. Volatile Keyword: Use the `volatile` keyword to declare the `helper` variable. This ensures that when the `helper` object is initialized, all its fields are properly initialized and visible to all threads:
   ```java
volatile Helper helper;
if (helper == null) {
    synchronized (this) {
        if (helper == null) {
            helper = new Helper();
        }
    }
}
   ```
2. Bill Pugh Singleton Pattern: Use the Bill Pugh singleton pattern to lazily initialize the `helper` object. This pattern ensures thread safety and eliminates the need for synchronization:
   ```java
private static class HelperHolder {
    private static final Helper INSTANCE = new Helper();
}
// usage
return HelperHolder.INSTANCE;
   ```
   Alternatively, if `Helper` has some sort of initialization which needs lazy loading use this pattern
   ```java
private static class HelperHolder {
    private static final Helper INSTANCE;
    static {
        INSTANCE = new Helper();
    }
}
// usage
return HelperHolder.INSTANCE;
   ```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
if (helper == null) {
    synchronized (this) {if (helper == null) {helper = new Helper();}}
} return helper;
   ```
