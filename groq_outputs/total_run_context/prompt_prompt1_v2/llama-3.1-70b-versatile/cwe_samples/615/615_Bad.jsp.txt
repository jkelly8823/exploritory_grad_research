VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a FIXME comment indicating a known issue where calling the method with more than 30 arguments can cause the JDBC server to fail.

EXPLANATION:
The FIXME comment is a clear indication that the developers are aware of a potential issue with the method. However, the fact that it's still present in the code suggests that it hasn't been addressed yet. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or other issues if the method is called with a large number of arguments.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, I recommend implementing input validation to limit the number of arguments that can be passed to the method. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the method to ensure that the number of arguments does not exceed a safe threshold (e.g., 30 in this case). If the number of arguments exceeds the threshold, the method should throw an exception or return an error message.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate why the JDBC server is failing when called with more than 30 arguments and implement a more robust solution to prevent this issue.
