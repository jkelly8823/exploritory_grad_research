VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a Path Traversal Attack via a maliciously crafted "reportName" request parameter.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from directly concatenating user input ("reportName") to a file path without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to supply a malicious value for "reportName" that could potentially delete any file on the system, rather than just the desired report. This is a classic example of Path Traversal, also known as Directory Traversal.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's essential to validate and sanitize the "reportName" parameter before using it to construct a file path. 

Here are some suggestions:
1) **Validate input:** Ensure that the "reportName" parameter matches a specific format or pattern, e.g., only contains alphanumeric characters or specific special characters.

2) **Use a whitelist approach:** Keep a list of allowed report names and verify that the provided "reportName" is in the whitelist.

3) **Sanitize input:** Remove any directory traversal characters (e.g., '..', '/') from the input.

4) **Use a secure directory structure:** Store reports in a directory that is not accessible to external users, and ensure that the report directory is properly secured with required permissions.

Here's an example of how you could modify the code to fix this vulnerability:

```java
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
// Sanitize and validate input
String[] allowedReportFormats = {"csv", "pdf", "xlsx"}; // Define allowed formats
String baseReportDir = "/usr/local/apfr/reports/"; // Define the base reports directory

// Filter and validate the reportName
rName = sanitizeInput(rName); // Implement your own sanitizeInput method
String[] reportNameParts = rName.split("\.");
String extension = reportNameParts[reportNameParts.length - 1];

if (isInArray(allowedReportFormats, extension)) {
    File rFile = new File(baseReportDir + sanitizeInput(rName)); // Use sanitized reportName
    // Now it is safe to delete the report file
    rFile.delete();
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);
// ...
rFile.delete();
```
