VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the possibility of sensitive data exposure due to inadequate input validation in the file path construction. The code uses user-provided input (cfg.getProperty("sub")) to construct the file path without validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially manipulate the file path and access sensitive files on the system, leading to unauthorized data exposure or even code execution. Although it's unclear how the property 'sub' is set, this should be validated to prevent an attacker from controlling the input.

Additionally, the code also uses the 'FileInputStream' without handling potential exceptions. If an exception is thrown, this could potentially be used in an Exception-based information disclosure vulnerability.

Furthermore, the code prints the data read from the file directly to the output. If the data in the file is not correctly validated or sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious data, potentially leading to issues such as XSS attacks or unintended code execution if this output is used in another application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the user-provided input before using it in the file path construction. Ensure that the file path adheres to the expected pattern, and it does not allow an attacker to traverse the directory structure.
2. Use a secure method to construct the file path, such as using the 'Path' class and its methods.
3. Handle potential exceptions properly when working with file operations to prevent potential Exception-based information disclosure vulnerabilities.
4. Implement proper error handling for file operations. 
5. Validate the contents of the file before printing it to the output.

ORIGINAL CODE:
fis = new FileInputStream(cfg.getProperty("sub")+".txt");amt = fis.read(arr);out.println(arr);
