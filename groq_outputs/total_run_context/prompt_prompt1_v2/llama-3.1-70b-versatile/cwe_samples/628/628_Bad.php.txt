VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None ( Due to incomplete code snippet), however vulnerability exists around the function call "authenticate($_POST['password'], $_POST['username']);" if we were to write new incorrect passwords that reverse the 2 params given to function arguments 'username' first then 'password'

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Vulnerability

While this function does appear to swap username/password order which is  not a vulnerability in and of itself, if this swapped order would persist through function calls on further pages/requests made from given username, then a switch as used in this authentication instance has potential to possibly be used as a backdoor key later. Furthermore, swapping keys can cause functions that uses those given parameters elsewhere in the code to return false negative on key validation on succeeding user sessions.


EXPLANATION:
The given function 'authenticate' expects 'username' as the first parameter and 'password' as the second. However, while making the actual function call, the parameters are passed in reverse order, henceforth calling 'authenticate($_POST['password'], $_POST['username'])'.



Its value in exploiting login credentials will not materialize immediately given source of passed credentials has not also been swapped.



In determining if IDOR-type vulnerabiltiy to occur as described above on follow-up usage after first use still has false-negative as validation result, we would also need other sources not provided, how to handle swapped credentials as bad requests or bad source (validation key request). 

To add weight to  incorrect parameters/return- and false-negative,  consider what a really serious backdoors could permit from successful key-swapped instances (e.g., do our backend, main or sub-sequence validation procedures result the same error "IDOR" false negatives? Or does the likely false negatives given first usages permit really only some level requests of an otherwise invalid request?"



What creates real exploitation risk here in any case is using, as given in incorrect order a swapped false negative key instance as valid "key with really valid usage to our subsequence back or entry as "the invalidated and invalidated key as valid usage session type request with other "key request to procedure and backend result false validation"). 



RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Directly use a 'key-value' as arguments instead of passing directly sensitive user input as arguments.

2. In case the users' credentials passed in URL parameters was intended, a simple reevaluation of the application from an authentication standpoint may be required.



ORIGINAL CODE:
  
  function authenticate($username, $password) {
                
                   // authenticate user
                   ...
  }
  authenticate($_POST['password'], $_POST['username']); 
The main problem however being that swapping can make false negative if they appear in user requests that needs "key parameters in an entry" 'requests in order that can and the switch key-usage exploits in any valid form an error message if they create  of true to false on session requests from  key user'
