VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Authentication bypass vulnerability due to missing error handling.
EXPLANATION:
The provided PHP code snippet connects to a database and attempts to authenticate a user. However, it does not include any error handling to check if the authentication was successful. This could potentially lead to an authentication bypass vulnerability, where an attacker may be able to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the database.
 
The fact that this line is vulnerable does not necessarily stem from this line itself, but rather the lack of any error handling to prevent it from executing in the event of a failed authentication attempt.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- The code should be modified to include error handling to check the return value of the authenticateUser() function. 
- It is also recommended that authentication should be performed on the server-side in a secure manner, preferably using a tried and tested library such as OWASP ESAPI Authenticator.
- When connecting to the database, make use of prepared statements with parameterized queries, or a reputable ORM, to reduce the risk of SQL Injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<?php
include('database.inc');
$db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword);
$db.authenticateUser($username, $password);
?>
