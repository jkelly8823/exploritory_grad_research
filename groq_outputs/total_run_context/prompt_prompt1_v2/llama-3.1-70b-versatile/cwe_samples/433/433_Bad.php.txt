VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (this is a configuration issue)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database credentials and weak password.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, which is a significant security vulnerability. Hardcoding sensitive information such as database names and passwords can lead to unauthorized access to the database. Furthermore, the password 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$' appears to be weak, as it does not follow password complexity guidelines. A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

Additionally, storing sensitive information in plain text is insecure. It is advisable to use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms to store sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms to store database credentials instead of hardcoding them.
2. Generate a strong, unique password that follows password complexity guidelines for the database.
3. Consider using a secrets manager or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?>
