VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of an unchecked function for user input (fgets).

EXPLANATION:
The fgets function in C only guarantees that it will null-terminate the string if the input buffer is completely filled, which leaves a window for a buffer overflow attack if the buffer is not properly checked for length. However, fgets itself will not overflow, as it reads at most one less than the specified size, leaving space for a null. The vulnerability may arise from an improper handling of its return value or incorrect buffer capacity allocation. As fgets() prevents buffer overflow up to the first argument and does not overflow up to its last two characters of the pre-allocated space for null, it is still necessary to address the situation where fgets runs out of capacity altogether.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since fgets is used here, then the handling of its return value should be properly ensured. The return value should be checked so un-expected null or 0's in the system is prevented and these must be correctly handled so proper flow is ensured to gain further protection against unnecessary buffer overflow to make the buffer overflow input  less potent, due to error handling (albeit that many fgets is being utilized to prevent over-write a null and as many arguments is utilizing and applied).


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char buffer[1024];
...fgets(buffer, 1024, stdin);
