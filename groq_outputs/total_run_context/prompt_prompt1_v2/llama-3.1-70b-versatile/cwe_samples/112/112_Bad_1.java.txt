VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Unvalidated DocumentBuilderFactory newInstance(). The XML parser configuration used here is not secure. It makes the application vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, we notice that DocumentBuilderFactory is used without explicitly disallowing the external entities expansion (XXE). If not properly secured, an attacker can inject malicious external entities which can potentially read local files or post content to the internal network when parsing XML data from untrusted sources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the feature `http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl` to `true` in order to disallow document type declarations.
2. Set the feature `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities` to `false` in order to disallow external general entities which is necessary to prevent external general entity references from being used to send confidential data to the attacker's server.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
builderFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);
builderFactory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
builderFactory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
DocumentBuilder builder = builderFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();builderFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);DocumentBuilder builder = builderFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
```
