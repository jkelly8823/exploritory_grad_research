VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability (CWE-22)

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability occurs in the code snippet because the `GetUntrustedInput()` function is used to retrieve user input, which is then appended to a file path without proper validation. This input is filtered to remove '../', but this filter can be bypassed by using various encoding techniques, such as '././' or absolute paths. This allows an attacker to potentially traverse the file system and access restricted areas.

The `s/\.\.\///` line is an attempted fix for this vulnerability, but it is not sufficient as it can be easily bypassed by an attacker.

The `ReadAndSendFile($filename)` function call further exacerbates the vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to potentially read or send sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Properly validate and sanitize user input using a whitelist approach. Only allow known acceptable input characters.
- Use a robust path canonicalization function to normalize the file path, ensuring that it matches the intended directory.
- Implement least privilege principles for file access and use secure defaults.
- Consider using a secure library or framework to handle file I/O.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
