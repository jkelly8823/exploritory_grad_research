VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource Exhaustion due to Infinite or Excessive Iteration

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists because the code does not handle cases where the getNextMessage function returns 0 or a negative value. If getNextMessage fails and returns 0 or a negative value, the while loop will continue indefinitely as the `isValidUser` variable will never be set to 1, and `count` will wrap around and start from a high value if large enough. This could lead to resource exhaustion due to excessive iteration. 

Furthermore, `getNextMessage` is called without checking its return value for potential error conditions. This could lead to resource leaks or undefined behavior if the function returns an error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:
- Check the return value of `getNextMessage` function and handle potential error conditions, such as disconnects or buffer overflows.
- Ensure the while loop terminates after a reasonable number of attempts and that `count` is not a signed integer that can wrap around.
- Limit the number of attempts to prevent resource exhaustion.

ORIGINAL CODE:
      int validateUser(char *host, int port){
            ...
               int count = 0;while ((isValidUser == 0) && (count < MAX_ATTEMPTS)) {
                  if (getNextMessage(socket, username, USERNAME_SIZE) > 0) {if (getNextMessage(socket, password, PASSWORD_SIZE) > 0) {isValidUser = AuthenticateUser(username, password);}}count++;
               }if (isValidUser) {return(SUCCESS);}else {return(FAIL);}
         }
