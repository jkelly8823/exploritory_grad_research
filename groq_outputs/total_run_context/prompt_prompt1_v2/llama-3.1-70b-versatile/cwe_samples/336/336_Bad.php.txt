Insecure Random Session ID Generation

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet has a function `generateSessionID` that generates a session ID using the `rand()` function in PHP, which is seeded with the user ID. This approach has several security concerns. The `srand()` function uses the system time as a seed when not provided any parameter. However, by using a fixed seed like user ID, it's not truly random. Also, `rand()` function is not cryptographically secure.

Furthermore, using the user ID as a seed for generating session IDs can lead to predictability and make the session IDs easier to guess or calculate. 

Lastly, if an attacker manages to get access to one or more session IDs and corresponding user IDs, they can predict future session IDs for that user or even other users.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG), such as [random_bytes()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php) or [random_int()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-int.php), to generate session IDs. These functions are designed to produce cryptographically secure random numbers that are suitable for generating session IDs. The session ID generation function can be rewritten using these functions.

Here's an example of using `random_bytes()` to generate a session ID:

```php
function generateSessionID($userID)
{
    return bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function generateSessionID($userID){srand($userID);return rand();}
```
