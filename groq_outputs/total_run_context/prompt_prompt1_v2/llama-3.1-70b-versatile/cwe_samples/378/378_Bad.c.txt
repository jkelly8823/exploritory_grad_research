VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a resource leak vulnerability and does not properly handle the removal of the temporary file.

EXPLANATION:
The code creates a temporary file using `tmpfile()`, which returns a `FILE*` that needs to be closed with `fclose()` when it's no longer needed. However, there's a possibility that an exception may occur between the creation of the temporary file and its removal with `rm()` (which is passed the `tmp` variable, but has not been declared here). If that happens, the temporary file will remain on the system forever, causing a resource leak. Additionally, the code attempts to remove the temporary file using `rm()` (which itself may be a security vulnerability, as it calls out to the shell and might be vulnerable to command injection) rather than using the correct `fclose()` and `unlink()` methods.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended that you properly handle the removal of the temporary file using `fclose()` and `unlink()` to prevent resource leaks. Additionally, avoid using `rm()` as it may introduce additional security issues and instead opt for `unlink()`. Here's an updated version of the snippet:

```c
FILE *stream;
if ((stream = tmpfile()) == NULL) {
    perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");
    return (-1);
}
// write data to tmp file
...
fclose(stream); // Close the file to free the file descriptor
unlink("path/to/tmpfile"); // Remove the temporary file correctly
```

Original Code:
```c
FILE *stream;
if ( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) {
    perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");
    return (-1);
}
// write data to tmp file
...
// remove tmp file
rm(tmp);
```
