VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Resource Leak
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a potential resource leak due to the BufferedReader being closed only if no exceptions occur before the close statement. If an IOException occurs, the catch block catches the exception and discards it, and the out object remains open. This can lead to resource leaks if this code is executed many times without being able to close the resource due to an exception. Furthermore, exception is not handled meaningfully in this case and its cause is lost which can hide serious programming errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The use of a try-with-resources statement is recommended to ensure the BufferedWriter is closed properly, even if an IOException occurs during the execution of the write statement. In addition to that, Exception handling should also be taken care so that exceptions are properly handled and application remains in a known state.
```java
try (BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(File.createTempFile("pattern", ".suffix")))) {
    out.write("aString");
} catch (IOException e) {
    // log the exception or perform some meaningful operation on it
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
try {File temp = File.createTempFile("pattern", ".suffix");temp.deleteOnExit();BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(temp));out.write("aString");out.close();}catch (IOException e) {}
```
