VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet has a potential use-after-free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a free operation on a pointer in two locations, one of which is conditional (`if (abrt) {free(ptr);}`). If `abrt` is true, `ptr` is freed. However, the code then attempts to free `ptr` again unconditionally. Although this second free operation will not result in a direct error, it can cause issues if the memory is reallocated and the second free is executed, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited if the memory can be reallocated in a manner that allows the attacker to control its contents.

However, considering the two free operations are sequential, the use-after-free scenario is unlikely to occur, but there's still a memory leak potential issue.

Another potential issue with this code snippet is to check if `abrt` is false in cases before accessing any memory (`ptr`) before it's second free operation call in order to properly handle a free of it from a resource management function, particularly if this code snippet's methods execution in different logical contexts (threading?).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the duplicate free() call as it can likely be eliminated in a safe release implementation and may introduce issues as described earlier.
2. Check if the pointer was already freed before freeing it, in order to prevent invalid free calls.
3. Always check for allocation errors when using `malloc()` (no checks being done for `SIZE` whether that is finite or a pointer being populated.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
