VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6, 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when the `logMessage` pointer is freed within the `handler` function, but then the program potentially continues to execute the signal-handling code path due to the presence of a `sleep` call.

EXPLANATION:
The `handler` function is registered to handle two signals, `SIGHUP` and `SIGTERM`. When either of these signals is received, the `handler` function is executed. Within the `handler` function, the code frees the `logMessage` memory and then calls `sleep(10)`, which artificially increases the size of the timing window. If either signal is received during this time, the program may attempt to access the `logMessage` pointer even though it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, avoid freeing the `logMessage` pointer within the signal handler. Instead, use a flag to signal that the program should exit and then free the memory from the main thread before exiting.

```
int stopFlag = 0;

void handler (int sigNum) {
    stopFlag = 1;
}

int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
    logMessage = strdup(argv[1]);
    /* Register signal handlers. */
    signal(SIGHUP, handler);
    signal(SIGTERM, handler);
    while (!stopFlag) {
        sleep(10);
    }
    free(logMessage);
    exit(0);
}
```

Alternatively, use `syslog` with a synchronous mode (`openlog` function) to ensure the syslog message is fully sent before handling the signal.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char *logMessage;
void handler (int sigNum) {
    syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "%s\n", logMessage);free(logMessage);
    /* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */
    sleep(10);exit(0);
}
int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
    logMessage = strdup(argv[1]);
    /* Register signal handlers. */
    signal(SIGHUP, handler);signal(SIGTERM, handler);
    /* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */
    sleep(10);
}
```
