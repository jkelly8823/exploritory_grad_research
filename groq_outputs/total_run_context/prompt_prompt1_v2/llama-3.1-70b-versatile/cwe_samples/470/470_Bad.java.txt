VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability due to Unvalidated User Input in Class Loading

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the unvalidated use of user input in class loading. The `request.getParameter("ctl")` call retrieves an input from the user's request, which is then directly concatenated to the string "Command" and used as an argument to `Class.forName()`, which attempts to load the class specified by the fully qualified class name.

Since the `ctl` parameter comes directly from user input, an attacker can potentially manipulate the class name to execute arbitrary malicious code by injecting the desired class name. This can lead to remote code execution.

Furthermore, the `newInstance()` method is called on the newly loaded class, which can execute any malicious code contained within the class's constructor. Finally, the `doAction(request)` method is called on the newly created instance, which may execute additional malicious code within the `doAction()` method.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Validate and sanitize the user input to prevent injection of malicious class names.
2. Implement a whitelist of allowed class names to prevent loading of arbitrary classes.
3. Use a more secure approach to dynamic class loading, such as using a `Class.forName()` with a context class loader or using a dependency injection framework.

Additionally, the following code changes could be made:
```java
String[] allowedClasses = {"ValidClass1", "ValidClass2"}; // Whitelist of allowed classes
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
if (Arrays.asList(allowedClasses).contains(ctl)) {
    Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");
    Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();
    ao.doAction(request);
} else {
    // Handle invalid class name
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");
Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();
ao.doAction(request);
```
