VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to Command Injection attacks. The use of Az CLI with variable input for resource group and storage account name could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code uses the Az CLI command 'az storage account show' with the '-g' and '-n' flags. The variables {ResourceGroupName} and {StorageAccountName} are used to populate the values for the flags. However, if an attacker can manipulate the values of these variables, they may be able to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the input values for resource group and storage account name should be validated and sanitized to prevent malicious commands. If possible, consider using a parameterized query or prepared statement to ensure that the inputs are properly escaped. Additionally, consider using the "--account-key" or "--account-name" flags with the 'az storage account show' command instead of injecting the account name as a command argument.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  az storage account show -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName}
