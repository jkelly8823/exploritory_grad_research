VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Connection and Missing Error Handling.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet establishes an HTTP connection to a specified URL and attempts to send a PUT request. However, it uses an insecure protocol ("http") and does not verify the identity of the server, leaving it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Moreover, the error handling mechanism is insufficient, as the IOException is caught but its details are not logged or handled, which can make debugging and attack detection difficult.

Additionally, line 5 (hu.connect();) directly connects to the server without verifying the SSL certificate of the server, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using a secure protocol, such as HTTPS (http**s**://), to encrypt data being sent to and from the server.
- Use URL's toConnect() method which sends a request for reading the document located at the specified URL. 
- Verify the SSL certificate of the server by implementing a custom HostnameVerifier and using the 'https' protocol instead of 'http'.
- Add proper error handling mechanism by logging the exception and taking necessary actions.
- Consider using more high-level APIs, such as OkHttp or Apache HttpClient, which provide more robust and secure features.
