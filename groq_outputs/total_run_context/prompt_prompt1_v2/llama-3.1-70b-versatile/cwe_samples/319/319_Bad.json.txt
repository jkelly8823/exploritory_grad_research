VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The JSON object represents a storage account configuration, where "enableHttpsTrafficOnly" is set to "false", allowing non-secure HTTP traffic.

EXPLANATION:
In this JSON object, the "enableHttpsTrafficOnly" property is explicitly set to "false". This means that the storage account is configured to allow both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Allowing non-secure HTTP traffic can make the storage account vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to set "enableHttpsTrafficOnly" to "true". This will ensure that only secure HTTPS traffic is allowed to access the storage account. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
    { 
      "name": "{StorageAccountName}",
      "enableHttpsTrafficOnly": false,
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
