VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a Phishing Attack.

EXPLANATION:
Phishing attacks often use legitimate-looking URLs to trick users into visiting malicious sites or downloading malware. In this case, the URL appears to point to a "useful-page" on a separate domain, but an attacker could easily use social engineering tactics to make it seem like this link is legitimate. Additionally, the link is opening in a new tab (target="_blank") which might not show the full URL, making it even harder for users to verify the link's authenticity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the authenticity of the URL before linking to it. Ensure that the URL points to a legitimate page and not a phishing site.
2. Consider opening the link in the same tab, or else make sure the browser's URL bar is visible when opening the link in a new tab.
3. Use a library or tool to validate the safety of the URL or website before linking to it.
4. Make sure that users are aware that they are leaving the original domain when they click on the link.
