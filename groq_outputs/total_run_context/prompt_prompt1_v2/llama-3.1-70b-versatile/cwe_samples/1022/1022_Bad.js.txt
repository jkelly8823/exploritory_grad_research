VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Tabnabbing vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `window.open` function to open a new window with a hardcoded URL from an external domain. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious content, including JavaScript code, into the new window, which can result in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Furthermore, this can also lead to a Tabnabbing vulnerability, where an attacker can replace the new tab's content with a phishing page or other malicious content that mimics a legitimate website.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of using `window.open` with an external URL, consider using a secure alternative, such as opening a new tab or window within your own domain.
- Validate and sanitize any user input that may be used to generate the URL.
- Use the `noopener` and `noreferrer` attributes when calling `window.open` to prevent the new window from accessing the original window's context.
- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed within your application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
