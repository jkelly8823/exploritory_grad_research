None detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a digital circuit design in Verilog, implementing a module for an AES encryption process. The snippet is focused on an always block triggered by the rising edge of a clock signal. It checks for various conditions including a reset signal and an encryption process completion signal. 

The code seems to be sanitizing the `p_c` array when certain conditions are met. However, without knowing the purpose or the full context of the `p_c` array, it's difficult to determine the correctness of this sanitization process. Nonetheless, the current snippet does not show any obvious vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
module aes0_wrapper #(/*...*/)(/*...*/);
   ...
   always @(posedge clk_i)
   
     begin
     
       if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at reset
       
         ...
       
       else if(ct_valid) //encryption process complete, clear p_c[i]
       
         begin
         
           p_c[0] <= 0;
           p_c[1] <= 0;
           p_c[2] <= 0;
           p_c[3] <= 0;
         
         end
       
       else if(en && we)
       
         case(address[8:3])
         ...
         endcase
       
       end // always @ (posedge wb_clk_i)
     
     endmodule
