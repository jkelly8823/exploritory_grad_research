VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Secret Storage Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a function call to `get_secret()`, which suggests that it handles sensitive data. This secret is then stored in a buffer called `cleartext_buffer`. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the buffer is not securely erased, especially on memory reallocation, before being reused. The function `scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer, 1024)` is an attempt to securely erase the buffer, but it may be called after sensitive data has already been written to it. 

However, memory reallocation with `realloc` on line number 1 introduces a vulnerability. If an attacker was able to cause a buffer overflow on the initial allocation before scrubbing the memory, the secret could be exposed. In cases where `realloc` is used, there's an intermediate window where the data is temporarily copied into its new allocation before it's scrubbed in the final state; thus providing an additional vector for the data to be intercepted and potentially further exposing sensitive data. This window of exposure can be critical.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that `scrub_memory` is called on the original buffer directly after `get_secret()` when it's no longer needed.
- Consider using `calloc` or `malloc` instead of `realloc` to minimize the exposure window.
- It is recommended to review how this secret is being generated and validated as any security risks in those segments of code could add to or exacerbate the risks found here.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
cleartext_buffer = get_secret();...cleartext_buffer = realloc(cleartext_buffer, 1024);...scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer, 1024);
```
