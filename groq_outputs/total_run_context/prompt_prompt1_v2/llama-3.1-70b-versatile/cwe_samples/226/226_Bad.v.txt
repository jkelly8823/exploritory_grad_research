VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a data exposure vulnerability due to improper access control.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the `always @(posedge clk_i)` block, specifically in the `case (address[8:3])` statement. The code uses the `address` signal to determine which register to write to, but it does not properly validate the `address` signal. This allows an attacker to potentially write to arbitrary registers by manipulating the `address` signal. Furthermore, the code does not properly check the `reglk_ctrl_i` signal, which seems to be controlling access to certain registers. This could allow an attacker to bypass access control and write to sensitive registers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the `address` signal to ensure it is within a valid range before writing to a register. Additionally, the code should properly check the `reglk_ctrl_i` signal to ensure it is properly configured before allowing writes to sensitive registers. This can be achieved by adding bounds checking and access control checks before writing to registers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
module aes0_wrapper #(...)(...);
...
always @(posedge clk_i)
begin
  if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at reset
  begin
    start <= 0;
    p_c[0] <= 0;
    p_c[1] <= 0;
    p_c[2] <= 0;
    p_c[3] <= 0;
    ...
  end
  else if(en && we)
  case(address[8:3])
    0:
      start  <= reglk_ctrl_i[1] ? start  : wdata[0];
    1:
      p_c[3] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[3] : wdata[31:0];
    2:
      p_c[2] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[2] : wdata[31:0];
    3:
      p_c[1] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[1] : wdata[31:0];
    4:
      p_c[0] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[0] : wdata[31:0];
    ...
  endcase
  end // always @ (posedge wb_clk_i)
end
endmodule
```
