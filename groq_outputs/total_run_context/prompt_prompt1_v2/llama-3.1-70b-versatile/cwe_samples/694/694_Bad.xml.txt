VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate form names in the same document can cause unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities due to ambiguous form submissions.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes a formset containing two separate forms, each with the same name attribute ("ProjectForm"). When multiple forms with the same name are present, it can lead to ambiguous form submissions, as the browser may not know which form to submit. This can lead to unexpected behavior, and potentially, security vulnerabilities. A malicious actor could exploit this ambiguity to manipulate form submissions, leading to unauthorized actions or potential security breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure each form in the formset has a unique name attribute. Consider revising the code to assign distinct names to each form, ensuring clear and unambiguous form submissions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<form-validation>

    <formset>

         <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
         <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>

    </formset>

</form-validation>
```

Suggested fix:
```
<form-validation>

    <formset>

         <form name="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
         <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>

    </formset>

</form-validation>
```
