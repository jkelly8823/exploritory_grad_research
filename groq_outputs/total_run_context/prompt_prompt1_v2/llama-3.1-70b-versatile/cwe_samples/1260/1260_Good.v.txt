VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet defines local parameters for peripheral lengths and associates them with defined base addresses. No security vulnerabilities were identified as it merely declares and assigns values to enumerations and local parameters. The code appears to be implementing a simple enumeration for peripheral base addresses in a Systems-on-Chip (SoC) design, likely written in SystemVerilog. The values are hardcoded and do not involve any user input or external data, which reduces the likelihood of a vulnerability. However, it would require further analysis to ensure these addresses are not being used to bypass memory access controls or manipulate the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided as this code appears to be secure.
