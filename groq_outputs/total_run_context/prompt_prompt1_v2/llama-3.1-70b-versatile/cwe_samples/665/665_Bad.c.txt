VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbound strcpy and potential buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet uses strcat function without initializing the 'str' array. The array is only declared but not initialized before calling the strcat function. Since the array 'str' is declared without an initial value, the strcat function will append "hello world" starting from the first byte where a null byte '\0' is found. If no null byte is found within the array, this will result in undefined behavior.
 Moreover, since the string "hello world" has 11 characters and the array 'str' can hold a maximum of 20 characters, though it may fit in this case, use of strcat without knowing the source string's length is discouraged as it can cause buffer overflow issues in many other cases. A safer approach is to use other string copying functions like strlcpy, where the destination buffer size is specified to avoid such issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended way to fix this is to use strcpy (or any other string copying function that allows to specify the destination buffer size) followed by strcat to ensure the string does not exceed the array's size:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str[20]; 
    strcpy(str, "hello ");
    strcat(str, "world");
    printf("%s", str);
    return 0;
}
```

Alternatively, use a safer string copying function like strlcpy:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str[20];
    char temp[] = "hello world";
    strlcpy(str, temp, sizeof(str));
    printf("%s", str);
    return 0;
}
```

Or memset str to 0 before calling strcat:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str[20];
    memset(str, 0, sizeof(str));
    strcat(str, "hello world");
    printf("%s", str);
    return 0;
}
```

Note: It is also important to include necessary headers, define a main function (if it's a standalone program), and handle errors as necessary in the complete code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char str[20];strcat(str, "hello world");printf("%s", str);
