VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated allocation of memory based on user-controlled input
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `num_imgs` variable is assigned the result of `get_num_imgs()` without proper validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `num_imgs` value, potentially leading to a large allocation of memory, which can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or make the system more vulnerable to other attacks. Additionally, the lack of validation can lead to potential integer overflows when multiplying `num_imgs` with the size of the `img_t` struct.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the return value of `get_num_imgs()` to ensure it is within a reasonable range.
2. Implement a maximum allocation limit to prevent large allocations.
3. Consider using a safer allocation function like `calloc` instead of `malloc` to ensure that the allocated memory is initialized to zero.
4. Handle potential integer overflows when calculating the allocation size.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
```
