VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated user data leads to potential buffer overflow, and a NULL pointer dereference is not handled.
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using `malloc` for an array of `img_t` structures, but does not validate the size of `num_imgs` before making the allocation. If `num_imgs` is too large, this could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. 
Moreover, the return value of `malloc` is not checked for NULL pointer dereference, resulting in potential memory allocation issues and crashes if the allocation fails.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the code should be modified to validate `num_imgs` and to check for the return value of `malloc`:

```c
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();

if (num_imgs >= INT_MAX / sizeof(img_t)) {
  // handle integer overflow error
}

table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
if (table_ptr == NULL) {
  // handle allocation failure error
  // e.g. log the error or terminate program
}

```
This fix adds simple checks to prevent integer overflows and memory allocation issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
...
