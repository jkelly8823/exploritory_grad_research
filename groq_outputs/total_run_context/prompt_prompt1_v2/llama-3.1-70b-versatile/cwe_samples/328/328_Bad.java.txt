VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Password Storage using SHA-1 and Insecure Hash Comparison.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates insecure password storage and comparison practices. The use of SHA-1 as a MessageDigest algorithm is insecure for password hashing due to its vulnerability to collisions and pre-image attacks. Furthermore, the code stores the password as a byte array (`digest`), which is also insecure.

Additionally, the `equal(digest, secret_password())` line hints at an insecure hash comparison method, potentially using a timing-based comparison. This can lead to timing-based attacks, allowing an attacker to exploit the time difference between the comparisons to guess the correct hash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  **Use a secure password hashing algorithm:** Use a widely accepted and securely-designed password hashing algorithm, such as BCrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive to prevent brute-force attacks.

2.  **Use a secure comparison method:** Use a constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent timing-based attacks.

Here's an example of how you can implement secure password hashing and comparison using PBKDF2 in Java:

```java
// Hashing the password
SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1");
KeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(plainText.toCharArray(), salt, 10000, 256);
SecretKey secretKey = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);
byte[] hashedPassword = secretKey.getEncoded();

// Comparing the hashed password
MessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
byte[] hashingSecretPassword = messageDigest.digest(secret_password().getBytes());
boolean isPasswordValid = Arrays.equals(hashedPassword, hashingSecretPassword);

```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
//Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {
    login_user();
}
```
