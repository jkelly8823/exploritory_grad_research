VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Use of Insecure Hash Function and Potential Timing Attack.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the SHA1 hash function, which is considered insecure for password hashing due to its vulnerability to collisions and brute-force attacks. Additionally, the code compares the generated hash with a stored hash using the `equal()` function. This comparison is likely to be done using a simple string comparison, which can be vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker can exploit the timing difference between valid and invalid characters to guess the correct password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt. These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resilient to brute-force attacks. Additionally, a constant-time comparison function should be used to compare the generated hash with the stored hash, to prevent timing attacks. Here is an example of how the code could be modified to use Argon2 and a constant-time comparison function:

```c
#include <argon2.h> // Add the required library for Argon2
#include <hmac.h>  // Add the required library for HMAC

// Use Argon2 to generate a secure hash
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    uint32_t output_len = 32; // Specify the desired output length
    uint8_t *output = (uint8_t *) malloc(output_len * sizeof(uint8_t));
    argon2_hash_raw_data(plaintext, strlen(plaintext), NULL, 0, NULL, NULL,
                         output_len, output, Argon2_type_ID, NULL, NULL);

    // Use HMAC and a constant-time comparison function to compare the generated hash with the stored hash
    if (hmac_verify_secret(output, output_len, secret_password())) {
        login_user();
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    ctext = simple_digest("sha1", ciphertext, strlen(plaintext), ... );
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {
        login_user();
    }
}
```
