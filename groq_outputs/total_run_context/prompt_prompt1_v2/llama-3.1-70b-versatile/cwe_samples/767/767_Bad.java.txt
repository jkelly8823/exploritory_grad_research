VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Modification of User ID (UID)
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a method `setPID(int ID)` that, in addition to setting the `PID` to the supplied value, also sets the `UID` to this value. The `UID` is supposed to be a user identifier that maps to the `userName` and it should not be changed after it has been initially set. The change to `UID` may allow an attacker to impersonate another user, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- The `setPID(int ID)` method should only update the `PID` field without touching the `UID`. Remove the line `UID = ID;` from this method.
- The method name `setPID` suggests it should only modify the `PID`, and any other modifications should be handled through separate methods to avoid confusion and prevent insecure modifications.
- Consider adding checks to prevent other methods from modifying the `UID` after it has been set.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public class Client {private int UID;public int PID;private String userName;public Client(String userName){PID = getDefaultProfileID();UID = mapUserNametoUID( userName );this.userName =(userName);}public void setPID(int ID) {UID = ID;}}
