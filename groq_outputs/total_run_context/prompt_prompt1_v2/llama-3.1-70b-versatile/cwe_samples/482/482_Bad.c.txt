VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds read/write and potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, a buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `push` and `pop` functions. In the `push` function, when the `p1` pointer reaches the end of the stack (`tos+SIZE`), it does not exit the function but instead proceeds to write to an index past the end of the array. This behavior can lead to a buffer overflow. 

However, on line 4, instead of incrementing the pointer and assigning it the value `i` (`*p1++ = i;`), it is first incremented (`p1++`) and then assigned the value `i` (`*p1 == i;`). This is problematic for two key reasons. Firstly, this line will not compile because there is an errant equal sign. However, even though I will assume this is actually assignment versus comparison. `p1` is checking for the boundaries after it has already been incremented, which introduces a potential off-by-one bug.

The other function, `pop`, does not consume the top element properly and includes an off-by-one index. Instead of `return *p1;` and `p1--;`, it does `p1--; return *(p1+1);`. But because we do not see `p1--;` happens before returning `*p1`, nothing is changed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code snippet should be modified to fix the issues in the `push` and `pop` functions:

- Change `*p1 == i;` to `*p1 = i;` in the `push` function, 
- Change the `push` function to return or print an error when the stack has reached its capacity (`p1` is within the stack range of `tos` to `tos+SIZE` exclusive).
- For better practice change `p1--; return *(p1+1);` to `p1--; return *p1;` in the `pop` function.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
#define SIZE 50
int *tos, *p1, stack[SIZE];

void push(int i) {
   p1++;if(p1==(tos+SIZE)) {
      // Print stack overflow error message and exit
   }*p1 == i;
}
int pop(void) {
   if(p1==tos) {
      // Print stack underflow error message and exit
   }p1--;return *(p1+1);
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   // initialize tos and p1 to point to the top of stack
   tos = stack;p1 = stack;
   // code to add and remove items from stack
   ...return 0;
}
```
