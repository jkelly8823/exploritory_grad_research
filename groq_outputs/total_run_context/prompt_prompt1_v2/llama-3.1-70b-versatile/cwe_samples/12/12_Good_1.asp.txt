VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Information Disclosure

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals that custom errors are set to mode "On" and default redirects to a custom error page ("YourErrorPage.htm"). However, the custom error page itself might not be properly secured or handled, allowing for potential information disclosure if an unhandled error occurs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the custom error page ("YourErrorPage.htm") does not display sensitive information about the application or the error.
- Consider implementing a more secure error handling mechanism, such as logging the error and displaying a generic error message to the user.
- If you're using ASP.NET, consider setting the `redirectMode` attribute to `"ResponseRewrite"` to avoid exposing the original error page.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<pre>
&gt; &lt;customErrors mode=&quot;On&quot; defaultRedirect=&quot;YourErrorPage.htm&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

Additional notes: To better assess the vulnerability, a more comprehensive code review including the error handling mechanism and custom error page would be necessary.
