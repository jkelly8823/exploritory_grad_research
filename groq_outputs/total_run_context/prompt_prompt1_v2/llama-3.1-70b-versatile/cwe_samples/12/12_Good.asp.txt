VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Error Handling - CustomErrors in RemoteOnly mode

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment contains an ASP.NET web.config setting for custom error handling, which is set to 'RemoteOnly'. This means that detailed error messages will be displayed to users accessing the website remotely, while displaying custom errors locally. This mode is insecure as it may reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings to potential attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, set the custom errors mode to 'On' instead of 'RemoteOnly', so that custom error messages are displayed both locally and remotely, and detailed errors are not revealed. Alternatively, set it to 'Off' to display detailed error messages for local development and testing, but be sure to change this to 'On' in production. Consider using custom error pages to display friendly error messages to remote users.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" />
