VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Setting the customErrors mode to "Off" can potentially reveal sensitive information to attackers, as it allows detailed error messages to be displayed.

EXPLANATION:
The customErrors mode is set to "Off", which means that detailed error messages will be displayed to users in the event of an error. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the application, such as file paths, database connections, and other implementation details. An attacker can use this information to gain a better understanding of the application's internal workings and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to set the customErrors mode to "On" and specify a custom error page. This will prevent detailed error messages from being displayed to users and protect sensitive information from being revealed. Additionally, consider logging error messages and exceptions to a secure log file, so that they can be monitored and analyzed by authorized personnel.

ORIGINAL CODE:
