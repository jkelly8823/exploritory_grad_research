VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Uncontrolled format string vulnerability and potentially insecure password verification.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to uncontrolled format string attacks due to the potential for format string injection in the printf function calls. The password comparison is done using strcmp which is correct but it's missing the second parameter's closing parenthesis. This typo may lead to incorrect program behavior.

The main issue here is that the password comparison function is improperly written and missing brackets in its format string however, with that missing part added this function becomes incredibly insecure. A more robust password comparison should ideally use a constant time comparison function to prevent timing attacks.

Additionally, the hardcoded password comparison can be a security risk if the password needs to be changed or updated in multiple locations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement a constant time comparison function for the password comparison. You can use `strncmp` or `memcmp` to compare the password and include the second parameter's closing parenthesis:

    ```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    char correctPassword[] = "Mew!";
    if (strncmp(password, correctPassword, strlen(correctPassword)) != 0) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
        return(0);
    }
    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
    return(1);
}
```
However this should be done differently and as mentioned before there is the option of using a library implemented function for this purpose.

    ```c
#include <string.h>

int constant_time_strcmp(const char *a, const char *b) {
    int result = 0;
    while (*a && *b) {
        result |= *a - *b;
        a++;
        b++;
    }
    result |= (*a) - (*b);
    return result;
}

int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    char correctPassword[] = "Mew!";
    if (constant_time_strcmp(password, correctPassword) != 0) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
        return(0);
    }
    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
    return(1);
}
```
2.  Use a secure way to store and compare passwords. Hardcoding the password in plain text is not a good practice.

3.  Avoid using `strcmp` for sensitive data like passwords because it's vulnerable to timing attacks. We are replacing it with constant time comparison (`strncmp`, `memcmp`, or our own constant time function).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
        
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0)
    }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
}
```
