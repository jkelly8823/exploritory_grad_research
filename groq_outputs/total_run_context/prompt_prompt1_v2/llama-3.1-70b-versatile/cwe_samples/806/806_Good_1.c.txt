VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The use of `strncpy` without checking the length of the source string `filename` can lead to a buffer overflow. Although the third argument `sizeof(buf)-1` attempts to limit the copy size, the function `strncpy` does not null-terminate the string if the source string is longer than the specified length. This can result in an unterminated string, potentially allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer by manipulating the contents of `filename`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommend using `snprintf` instead of `strncpy`, ensuring that the buffer is always null-terminated. Additionally, it is crucial to check the length of the source string to prevent buffer overflows.

Here's an example of a safer approach:

```c
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s", filename);
```

Alternatively, you can use `strcpy` from the `string.h` library, which is safer than `strncpy` since it will always null-terminate the string:

```c
strcpy(buf, filename);
```

However, this requires a null-terminated source string `filename`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
// copy filename to buffer
strncpy(buf, filename, sizeof(buf)-1);
```
