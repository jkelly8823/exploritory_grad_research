VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (original code is an error message)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is using the `mysql_pconnect()` function with hardcoded credentials (`root` as the username and `N1nj4` as the password) in plain text.

EXPLANATION:
The error message indicates a failed database connection attempt. Although the original code snippet is not provided, the fact that the username (`root`) and password (`N1nj4`) are hardcoded in plain text within the error message raises significant security concerns. Hardcoding credentials can allow an attacker to easily obtain sensitive database login information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, never hardcode credentials in plain text. Instead, store them securely using environment variables or a secrets manager (such as Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager). Additionally, consider implementing authentication mechanisms that avoid the use of sensitive credentials in code. It is also recommended to avoid using `mysql_pconnect()` and instead use more secure libraries such as PDO or MySQLi with prepared statements.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Warning: mysql_pconnect(): Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: N1nj4) in /usr/local/www/wi-data/includes/database.inc on line 4
