VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code attempts to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by replacing occurrences of "script" with a mask. However, this approach is insufficient, as there are many other ways an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the input.

EXPLANATION:
The `preventXSS` method is attempting to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities by replacing the word "script" with a mask. However, this approach is vulnerable to many types of attacks, including:
- Injection of event handlers, like `onmouseover` or `onclick`
- Injection of malicious scripts encoded in different formats, like Unicode or hexadecimal
- Injection of scripts from other domains or protocols using attributes like `src` or `href`

A more comprehensive approach to preventing XSS would involve validating user input against a set of known-safe values and using a combination of encoding and filtering to ensure that malicious scripts are not executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of using a simple `replaceAll` approach, use a proven and tested library like OWASP's AntiSamy or a template engine like Mustache, which provides built-in XSS protection.
- Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict which scripts are allowed to run on your website.
- Validate and encode all user input data before including it in your HTML output.
- Use a comprehensive security testing toolset, including static analysis and dynamic analysis, to identify and fix potential security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public String preventXSS(String input, String mask) {
    return input.replaceAll("script", mask);
}
```
