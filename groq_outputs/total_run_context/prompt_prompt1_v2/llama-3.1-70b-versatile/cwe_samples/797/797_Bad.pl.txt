VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.
EXPLANATION:
The `GetUntrustedInput()` function retrieves user input, and then the input is used to construct a file path. The check `substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../'` only removes one level of traversal, i.e., '../', but a malicious user could input something like `"../../"` or `"../../../"` to traverse multiple levels of directories. This can be exploited to access arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or code execution. Additionally, even though we do not see the implementation of `ReadAndSendFile()`, the name and the context in which it is used suggest that it reads the file at the specified path and sends it, further suggesting that this vulnerability could lead to sensitive data being disclosed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Sanitize user input properly. This should include more than just checking for '../'. Consider using a whitelisting approach, where you only allow specific characters in the username.
2.  Consider using a proper path normalization function or library to handle directory traversal. This function should prevent the exploitation of '../' sequences.
3.  Consider storing user files in a separate directory and using an index or hash of the file to map to the user's ID. This approach would make it more difficult for a malicious user to determine the actual file path and traverse to other areas of the system.
ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {$Username = substr($Username, 3);}my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
