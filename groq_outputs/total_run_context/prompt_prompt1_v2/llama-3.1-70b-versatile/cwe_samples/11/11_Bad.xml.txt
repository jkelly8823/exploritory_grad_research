VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Debug mode enabled in production configuration.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be an ASP.NET web configuration file, specifically the Web.config file. The debug attribute is set to "true" in the compilation element, which enables debug mode for the application. This can pose a significant security risk if the application is deployed in production, as it allows for detailed error messages and potentially sensitive information to be exposed to users. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the debug attribute should be set to "false" in production environments. This will disable debug mode and prevent the application from exposing sensitive information via detailed error messages. Additionally, consider using a different configuration file or transforming the Web.config file for production environments to ensure that debug mode is always disabled.
