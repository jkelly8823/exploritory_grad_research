VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Kibitzer class's clone method, FancyKibitzer class's clone method
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Clone Method Implementation

EXPLANATION:
In Java, implementing the `clone()` method without properly calling through to `super.clone()` with the same parameters and handling it correctly can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. In the `Kibitzer` class, the `clone()` method does not call through to its superclass's `clone()` method, and in the `FancyKibitzer` class, the `clone()` method does call `super.clone()`, but its implementation can be bypassed if the subclass is not careful. 

However, it is also possible that this is the desired behavior and no vulnerability is present. Without more context or knowledge of the parent or child classes, it's impossible to be certain.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Firstly, verify if this is the desired behavior, if it's not, update the `clone()` methods in both classes to properly call the superclass's `clone()` method if necessary. Furthermore, consider implementing clone method in a way that allows the subclass to be able to handle their own state properly.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class Kibitzer {
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Object returnMe = new Kibitzer();...
    }
}
public class FancyKibitzer extends Kibitzer{
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Object returnMe = super.clone();...
    }
}
```
