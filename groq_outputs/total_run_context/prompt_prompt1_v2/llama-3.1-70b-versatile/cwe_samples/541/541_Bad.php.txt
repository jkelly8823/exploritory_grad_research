VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database credentials vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided PHP code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, which is a significant security vulnerability. The `$dbName` and `$dbPassword` variables contain the database name and password, respectively, in plain text. This makes it easy for an attacker to obtain these sensitive credentials if they gain access to the source code or logs. Hardcoding credentials also makes it difficult to rotate or update passwords, which is a common security practice.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to store database credentials securely, such as:

1.  Using environment variables: Store database credentials as environment variables, which can be set on the server or in a .env file.
2.  Using a secure secrets management service: Leverage a secrets management service, like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to securely store and retrieve sensitive credentials.
3.  Storing credentials in a secure file: If you cannot use environment variables or a secrets management service, consider storing database credentials in a secure file that is not committed to the repository. Use a PHP library or framework that supports secure credentials storage.

Example of using environment variables:

```php
$dbName = getenv('DB_NAME');
$dbPassword = getenv('DB_PASSWORD');
```
Make sure to set `DB_NAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables on your server or in a .env file.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
<?php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?>
```
