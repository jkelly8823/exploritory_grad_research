VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to insecure password verification and unauthenticated action. Furthermore, the input for the $pass and $checkpass variables are coming from an untrusted source which is the $_GET superglobal and this makes it also vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability occurs because the variables $pass and $checkpass are getting their values directly from the $_GET superglobal without proper validation and sanitization. In PHP, the $_GET superglobal should never be used for sensitive information like passwords as its values are user-controllable and easily accessible via URL manipulation.

Moreover, it is always recommended to avoid using '==='. In this case, we're dealing with passwords so type juggling isn't too much of an issue but if someone passes '0E1234567890' this would evaluate to true if one party is expecting a boolean value.

It's worth noting that any logic based on the comparison of user input without validation has security implications and additional vulnerabilities can potentially arise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use $_POST for sensitive information like passwords as it is more secure than $_GET and avoids publicly exposing sensitive data.
- Use prepared statements to validate the input parameters and to filter out any special characters that can potentially be harm the script or cause a SQL Injection attack.
- Store passwords securely by using a password hashing function that has proved itself to be highly secure like the built-in options provided by the PHP programming language such as password_hash() or provide other secure implementations for example Argon2 or PBKDF2.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$user = $_GET['user'];$pass = $_GET['pass'];$checkpass = $_GET['checkpass'];if ($pass == $checkpass) {SetUserPassword($user, $pass);}
