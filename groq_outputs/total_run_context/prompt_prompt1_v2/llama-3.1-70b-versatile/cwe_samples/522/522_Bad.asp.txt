VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Database Credentials
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet includes hardcoded database credentials, specifically a username and password, in plain text. This is a significant security risk, as it allows an attacker to easily gain access to the database and its contents. Hardcoding credentials is generally discouraged, especially when it comes to sensitive information like database passwords.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the hardcoded credentials should be replaced with a secure mechanism for storing and retrieving sensitive information. This can be achieved by using environment variables, a secrets manager, or a secure configuration file that is not committed to version control. The connection string should be updated to reference the secure storage mechanism, rather than hardcoding the credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  ...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
