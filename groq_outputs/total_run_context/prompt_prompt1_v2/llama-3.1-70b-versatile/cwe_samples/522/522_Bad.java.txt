VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet appears to be vulnerable to a 'Clear Text Password Storage' vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet loads a password from a properties file named 'config.properties', then uses this password to establish a database connection. The password is stored in plain text within the properties file, which poses a significant security risk. An attacker gaining access to this properties file would be able to retrieve the password and use it to access sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use secure password storage mechanisms: Store passwords securely using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or PBKDF2. Consider using a secrets management library or service to securely store and manage passwords.
2. Avoid storing plaintext passwords: Refrain from storing plaintext passwords in configuration files, environmental variables, or any other unsecured source.
3. Use environment variables: Store sensitive information such as database passwords in environment variables or a secure key-value store.
4. Encrypt the properties file: Consider encrypting the properties file or at least the password entry. This can be done using various encryption algorithms like AES.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));String password = prop.getProperty("password");DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);...
