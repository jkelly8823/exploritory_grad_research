VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded credentials/database connection string

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a hardcoded database connection string (`CONNECT_STRING`) that includes sensitive information such as the database host, port, and database name. Hardcoding credentials or connection strings in code is a serious vulnerability because it makes them easily accessible to unauthorized individuals. In the event of a security breach or code leak, this information could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secrets manager to store sensitive credentials and database connection information. This would allow you to separate sensitive data from the code and reduce the risk of exposure.

Here are some example steps to follow:

1. Replace the hardcoded `CONNECT_STRING` with a reference to an environment variable or a secure configuration file.
2. Use a secrets manager like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive database credentials.
3. Implement a secure configuration mechanism that allows you to manage and rotate database credentials without hardcoding them in the code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static final String CONNECT_STRING = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysqldb";
    private Connection conn = null;

    public DatabaseConnection() {}

    public void openDatabaseConnection() {
        try {
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(CONNECT_STRING);
        } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
    }

    // Member functions for retrieving database connection and accessing database...
}
