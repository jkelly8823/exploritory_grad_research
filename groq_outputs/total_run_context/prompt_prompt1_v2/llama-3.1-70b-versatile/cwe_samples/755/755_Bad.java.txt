VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure DNS Resolution.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains an insecure DNS resolution vulnerability. The `getHostName()` method of the `InetAddress` class performs a DNS resolution on the `addr` object. However, this method does not handle the potential exception that may arise when the host name cannot be resolved. Additionally, this method may cause a significant delay in the application's response time if the DNS resolution takes a long time to complete.

Furthermore, if the DNS resolution is performed on user-input data (as in this case, with `req.getRemoteAddr()`), it may be possible for an attacker to intentionally cause a slow or failed DNS resolution, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Handle the potential exception that may arise when the host name cannot be resolved. This can be done by wrapping the call to `getHostName()` in a try-catch block and handling the `UnknownHostException` that may be thrown.

2. Consider using a caching mechanism to store the results of previous DNS resolutions. This can help prevent a large number of DNS resolution requests from being made in a short amount of time.

3. Set a timeout for the DNS resolution to prevent slow or failed resolutions from causing a significant delay.

4. Validate and sanitize user-input data to prevent potential abuse.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
    String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
    ...out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());
}
```
