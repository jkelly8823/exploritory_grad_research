VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code may be vulnerable to a division by zero error, potentially leading to a runtime exception or undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION:
This code calculates the return on investment (ROI) by dividing the difference between the current value and the initial investment by the initial investment. However, if the initial investment is zero, this will result in a division by zero error. This is a concern because it may cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results, and it can also be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to add a check for division by zero before performing the calculation. This can be achieved by adding a simple if statement to ensure that the initial investment is not zero before performing the calculation. Here's an example of how the code can be modified:

```c
if (initialInvestment != 0) {
    returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;
} else {
    // Handle the division by zero error, e.g., return an error message
    // or throw an exception.
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;
```
