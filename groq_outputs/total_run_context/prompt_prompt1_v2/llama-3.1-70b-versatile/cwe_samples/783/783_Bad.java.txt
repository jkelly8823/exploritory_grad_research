VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This function contains a potential division by zero vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the line `returnROI = currentValue - initialInvestment / initialInvestment;`, the code is dividing `initialInvestment` by itself. This calculation will always result in 1, unless `initialInvestment` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. This suggests that the intention of the code was to divide the difference between `currentValue` and `initialInvestment` by `initialInvestment`, but due to operator precedence, this is not what is actually being performed. Furthermore, the division operator `/` has higher precedence than the subtraction operator `-`, so it will be evaluated first.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The correct way to calculate return on investment is to calculate the difference between `currentValue` and `initialInvestment`, and then divide the difference by `initialInvestment`. To fix this vulnerability, the line should be changed to:

```java
returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;
```

Additionally, you should add a check to prevent the division by zero error. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if `initialInvestment` is zero before attempting to divide by it.

```java
if (initialInvestment == 0.0) {
    throw new Exception("Initial investment cannot be zero");
}
returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public double calculateReturnOnInvestment(double currentValue, double initialInvestment) {
    
    double returnROI = 0.0;
    
    // calculate return on investment
    returnROI = currentValue - initialInvestment / initialInvestment;
    return returnROI;
}
```
