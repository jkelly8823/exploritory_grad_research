VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to an unchecked array index.

EXPLANATION:
 The variable `index` is obtained from `GetUntrustedOffset()`, which implies that its value can be controlled by an external user. This value is then used as an index into the `items` array. However, the code does not perform any bounds checking on this index, which means that if `index` is less than 1 or greater than 4, the program will access memory outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 To fix this vulnerability, you should perform bounds checking on the `index` variable before using it to access the array. You can do this by ensuring that `index` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive). Here is an example of how you can modify the code to add this check:

 ```c
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    char *items[] = {"boat", "car", "truck", "train"};
    int index = GetUntrustedOffset();
    if (index >= 1 && index <= 4) {
        printf("You selected %s\n", items[index-1]);
    } else {
        printf("Invalid selection\n");
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you could also consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector or a list, which would prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability altogether.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    char *items[] = {"boat", "car", "truck", "train"};
    int index = GetUntrustedOffset();
    printf("You selected %s\n", items[index-1]);
}
```
