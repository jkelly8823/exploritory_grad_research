VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overwrite Vulnerability and Memory Leak.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code has two main issues. 

The first issue is a memory leak caused by allocating memory for `message` twice. The line `char message[length+1];` allocates memory on the stack for `length+1` characters. This memory will be automatically freed when the function returns. However, just before that, the code also has `char *message = malloc(sizeof(char)*(length+1));` which allocates memory on the heap for `length+1` characters. This allocated memory is never freed. However, the code does use it correctly by returning `retMessage` which equals `message`. However the allocated heap memory is never used, only overwritten by stack memory.

The second issue is a buffer overwrite vulnerability in the for loop. The loop iterates over the input string `strMessage` up to the `length` index. However, the function does not check whether the input string's actual length is less than the provided `length` argument. If the string's actual length is less, this will result in buffer overwriting, or else will read from memory that has not been initialized by `strMessage`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Remove the unnecessary allocation on the heap and use the stack-allocated `message` variable directly. This will fix the memory leak.
2. Before copying the string, check that the input string's length is at least `length`. This can be done by checking the NULL character position using `strlen()`.
3. A better way to copy strings in C is to use functions like `strncpy()` or `strcpy()`, ensuring that you handle potential issues like buffer overflows or underflows properly.

Here is a simplified and more secure version of this code:

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

char* trimTrailingWhitespace(char *strMessage, int length) {
    char message[length+1];
    strncpy(message, strMessage, length);
    message[length] = '\0';
        
    // trim trailing whitespace
    int len = length-1;
    while (len >= 0 && isspace(message[len])) {
        message[len] = '\0';
        len--;
    }
            
    // trim leading whitespace not addressed in original code
    int i = 0;
    while (i < len && isspace(message[i])) {
        i++;
    }
            
    return strndup(message+i, len+1-i);
}

//Please note that you should manually free the memory returned from strndup.
```

However, since you just can work with the given snippet, focus on not using `message` the second time. Instead use `message` from the heap directly.

```c
char* trimTrailingWhitespace(char *strMessage, int length) {
    char *message = malloc(sizeof(char)*(length+1));
        
    // copy input string to a temporary string
    int index;for (index = 0; index < length; index++) {message[index] = strMessage[index];}message[index] = '\0';
            
    // trim trailing whitespace
    int len = index-1;while (isspace(message[len]) && len >= 0) {message[len] = '\0';len--;}
            
    // return string without trailing whitespace
    return message;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
char* trimTrailingWhitespace(char *strMessage, int length) {
    char *retMessage;char *message = malloc(sizeof(char)*(length+1));
            
    // copy input string to a temporary string
    char message[length+1];int index;for (index = 0; index < length; index++) {message[index] = strMessage[index];}message[index] = '\0';
            
    // trim trailing whitespace
    int len = index-1;while (isspace(message[len])) {message[len] = '\0';len--;}
            
    // return string without trailing whitespace
    retMessage = message;return retMessage;
}
```
