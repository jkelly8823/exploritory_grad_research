VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: N/A
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of the strcpy function.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the strcpy function to copy the contents of srcBuf into destBuf, starting at the index returned by the strstr function. However, the code does not check if the remaining space in destBuf is sufficient to hold the contents of srcBuf. This can lead to a buffer overflow if srcBuf is larger than the remaining space in destBuf.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function like strncpy instead of strcpy, and should also check the length of srcBuf to ensure that it does not exceed the remaining space in destBuf. Here is an example of how the code can be modified:

```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    int len = strlen(srcBuf);
    if (len > strlen(destBuf) - idx) {
        len = strlen(destBuf) - idx;
    }
    strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, len);
    destBuf[idx + len] = '\0';  // Add a null terminator
    ...
}
```
Alternatively, using a safer function like snprintf can also be used to avoid buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```
