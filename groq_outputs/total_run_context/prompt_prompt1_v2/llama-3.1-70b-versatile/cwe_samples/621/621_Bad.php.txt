VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to its use of the extract() function and user-controlled variable input.

EXPLANATION:
The extract() function takes an array (in this case, $_POST) and imports its variables into the current symbol table. This means that an attacker can pass any number of variables through the POST request, bypassing any validation or sanitization that may be present in other parts of the code. 

Since $user and $pass are being pulled from the POST request directly through extract(), and then only being escaped via mysql_real_escape_string() (which does not defend against all forms of SQL injection), an attacker can craft malicious input that can escape being sanitized, and compromise the database.

Furthermore, the use of mysql_query() and mysql_real_escape_string() is discouraged due to its deprecation and lack of protection against SQL Injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of building queries by concatenating user input. This will prevent SQL injection attacks. Ensure to use a library such as PDO or MySQLi.

2. Validate and sanitize user input. The extract() function should not be used in this context as it allows the user to inject any number of variables, potentially bypassing security checks. Consider using $_POST variables directly instead.

3. Switch to a newer, non-deprecated MySQL extension like MySQLi or PDO. This will also provide additional protection against SQL Injection attacks.

4. Avoid directly using user input as part of database queries, even when escaped, unless it is absolutely necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
//Log user in, and set $isAdmin to true if user is an administrator
// 
function login($user,$pass){$query = buildQuery($user,$pass);mysql_query($query);if(getUserRole($user) == "Admin"){$isAdmin = true;}}
$isAdmin = false;extract($_POST);login(mysql_real_escape_string($user),mysql_real_escape_string($pass));
```
