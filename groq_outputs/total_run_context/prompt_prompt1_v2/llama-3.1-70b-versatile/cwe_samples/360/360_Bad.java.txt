VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Potential Information Exposure. 
EXPLANATION:
The actionPerformed method is printing out secret information to the console when the button is clicked. This is a potential security risk as sensitive information may be exposed to unauthorized users.
However, the "secret information" is printed out directly in a non-configurable manner, and we cannot identify what this "secret information" contains. Given the immense stakes, it is best to prioritize on the side of caution and proceed with recommending fixes to account for potential exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of directly printing sensitive information to the console, implement proper access controls to protect the data. Consider logging mechanisms that allow for fine-grain control over what information is logged and at what level. Ensure that any sensitive data is properly secured and access is restricted to authorized users.

Moreover, considering this information might be sensitive, using System.out.println for logging in this manner in an event listener is not advised as the information may be caught by other components that are also listening for this type of event.

Also, ensure that you are using the correct logging level based on your application. Consider using a logging framework such as Logback or Log4j to help manage your logging in a centralized manner.
ORIGINAL CODE:
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {if (e.getSource() == button) {System.out.println("print out secret information");}}
