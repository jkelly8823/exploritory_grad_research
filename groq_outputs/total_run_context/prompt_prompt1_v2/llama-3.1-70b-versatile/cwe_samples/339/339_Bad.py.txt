VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of `urandom` for seeding PRNG.

EXPLANATION:
The `urandom` function is used to generate 2 bytes of randomness for seeding the PRNG. However, this may not be sufficient for generating a cryptographically secure random number. `urandom` can be exhausted if it's used too frequently or by multiple threads/processes of the same process.

Additionally, the use of 2 bytes for seeding is not sufficient. A secure seed should be at least 16 bytes (128 bits) to ensure the security of the PRNG.

The generated key is 128 bits long, which suggests the application requires high entropy. Therefore, using a weak seed to generate such a large key is a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix for this code is to use `secrets` module which provides cryptographic security. Use `secrets.token_bytes(n)` to generate a seed of appropriate length.

```
import secrets

seed = secrets.token_bytes(16)
random.seed(a=seed)
key = random.getrandbits(128)
```

Alternatively, if the requirement is to use `os.urandom` only, consider seeding with a longer sequence:

```
seed = os.urandom(16)
random.seed(a=seed)
key = random.getrandbits(128)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
# getting 2 bytes of randomness for the seeding the PRNG 
seed = os.urandom(2)
random.seed(a=seed)
key = random.getrandbits(128)
```
