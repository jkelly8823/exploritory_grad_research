VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unrestricted Hostname Resolution Vulnerability and potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to the use of a dynamically generated IP address for InetAddress resolution.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `getRemoteAddr()` method to get the IP address of the client, and then uses this IP address as the input for resolving the host name using `InetAddress.getByName(ip)`. This resolution of host name based on the untrusted client's IP address may potentially be used for SSRF attacks. Furthermore, the resolution may result in a significant performance lag due to DNS lookup and could potentially cause additional issues if the lookup fails.

Moreover, a malicious client can send a custom request with a spoofed IP address for `getRemoteAddr()`, forcing the `InetAddress.getByName()` function to resolve arbitrary host names.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the IP address to ensure it is a legitimate request and cannot be used for malicious purposes.
2. Use a trusted source of IP addresses when resolving host names.
3. Limit or disable reverse DNS resolution of IP addresses. 
4. Implement rate limiting on connections and request amounts per IP to prevent abuse. 
5. Implement error handling for DNS lookup failures.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);...out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());}
```
