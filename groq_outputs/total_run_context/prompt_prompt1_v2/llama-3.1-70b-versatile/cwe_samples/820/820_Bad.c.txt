VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability and arbitrary data disclosure.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `putc` to output individual characters. However, in the `print` function, the function is used with a variable that is directly controlled by the input string, which is `counter`. While the intention appears to be simply printing the characters of the string, if a null character is encountered (`\x00`), the program will encounter issues and possibly fail early or terminate incorrectly. Moreover, since the code doesn't handle the null character properly and uses the string without checking its integrity, this might cause the program to print garbage or arbitrary values until it encounters another null character.

Furthermore, in the `main` function, this could allow an attacker to disclose arbitrary data from memory. For example, if an attacker could control the input to the `print` function, they could potentially trigger this vulnerability by inputting a specially crafted string.

Additionally, there's a high level concern regarding 'Uncontrolled Format String' vulnerability here, though not directly applicable to `putc`. This would be more severe had `printf` been used directly as was often done in less secure versions of coding decades ago.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to properly handle null characters and validate the input string. This includes:

* Checking the string for integrity and null characters before printing it.
* Avoiding direct use of input strings for the `putc` function.

It's also crucial to review all areas in which functions that output data interact with strings input into the application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static void print (char * string) {
    char * word;int counter;for (word = string; counter = *word++; ) {
        putc(counter, stdout);fflush(stdout);
        /* Make timing window a little larger... */
        sleep(1);
    }
}
int main(void) {
    pid_t pid;
    pid = fork();if (pid == -1) {exit(-2);}else if (pid == 0) {print("child\n");}else {print("PARENT\n");}exit(0);
}
```
