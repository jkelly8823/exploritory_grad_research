VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) due to lack of validation and sanitization of user input.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks the class name of the `inputClass` object to ensure it is equal to a specific "TrustedClassName". This approach may be vulnerable to manipulation if an attacker can create an object with the same class name but different behavior. This code relies on the trustworthiness of the class name alone, which may not be sufficient. 

Additionally, this type of check can be bypassed with certain methods such as manipulating the `getClass()` method or making use of other Java-specific techniques to forge the object.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of relying solely on class name verification, you should implement a robust validation and sanitization mechanism for all inputs. This may include checking the provenance and credentials of the input, implementing ID-based access control, and enforcing strict validation of all data inputs.

As an added recommendation, consider verifying the input object against specific interface implementations, class characteristics, or function requirements that must be adhered to by your system, rather than relying on class names.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  if (inputClass.getClass().getName().equals("TrustedClassName")) {
                        
                           
                           // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
                           
                           
                           // ...
                           
                        
                     }
