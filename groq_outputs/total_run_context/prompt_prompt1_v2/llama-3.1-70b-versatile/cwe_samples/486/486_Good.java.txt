VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a "Insecure Use of Class Equality Check" vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the class of `inputClass` is equal to `TrustedClass.class` using the `getClass()` method and the `==` operator. This approach is insecure because it is possible for an attacker to create a malicious subclass of `TrustedClass` and pass an instance of that subclass as `inputClass`. In this case, the equality check would pass, allowing the malicious subclass to bypass the security check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `instanceof` operator to check if `inputClass` is an instance of `TrustedClass` or a subclass of it. This approach is more secure because it checks the entire class hierarchy of `inputClass`, not just its immediate class. Here's an example of how to fix the code:

```java
if (inputClass instanceof TrustedClass) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
}
```

Alternatively, if you need to ensure that `inputClass` is an instance of exactly `TrustedClass` and not a subclass, you can use the `getClass()` method and the `equals()` method:

```java
if (inputClass.getClass().equals(TrustedClass.class)) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (inputClass.getClass() == TrustedClass.class) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
    // ...
}
