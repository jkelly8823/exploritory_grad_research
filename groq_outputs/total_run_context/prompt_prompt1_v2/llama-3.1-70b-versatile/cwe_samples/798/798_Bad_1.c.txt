VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code compares a user input password with a hardcoded expected password, and if they do not match, it prints the message "Incorrect Password!". This indicates a potential cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code is storing a password in cleartext within the code itself. This can be easily seen in line 3, where it is directly comparing the input password with a hardcoded string ("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b"). Although this string appears to be an MD5 hash of a password, it still is vulnerable to several types of attacks (dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks). More importantly, the password comparing mechanism is located directly inside a conditional, indicating the password wasn't subjected to meaningful and more crucial security practices such as validation checks for password input before comparing the password to the hardcoded one.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. To improve the password verification, hash a password upon first receiving it from a user and store the hashed password securely. When the user tries to verify their password later, hash their provided input and compare the input's hash to the stored hash. By only handling hashed passwords instead of cleartext, this method allows for safe password handling and keeping sensitive information such as a user's password secure. More recent and resilient hashing algorithms, such as argon2id and PBKDF2 are also available. 
2. Use constant time string comparisons to avoid leaking timing side-channel information from vulnerable functions (e.g., string comparisons). 
3. Use safer functions in your password inputting like fgets() instead of scanf() or getchar() in case you read through those input methods instead of strings as is shown.

ORIGINAL CODE:
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    if (strcmp(password,"68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0);
    }
    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
