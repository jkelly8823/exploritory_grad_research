VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet stores sensitive database connection information (e.g., username, password) in plain text.

EXPLANATION:
Storing sensitive information such as database passwords directly in source code allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database. This can occur if an unauthorized party gains access to the source code or, in this case, the configuration file. Hard-coded credentials can lead to elevated privileges for attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, utilize environment variables or an encrypted configuration store to store the connection string. This can include using features like Azure App Configuration, AWS Secrets Manager, or storing credentials as environment variables. Additionally, use a standard connection string encryption algorithm or mechanisms provided by your framework (e.g., ASP.NET configuration encryption) to securely store and retrieve this information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
