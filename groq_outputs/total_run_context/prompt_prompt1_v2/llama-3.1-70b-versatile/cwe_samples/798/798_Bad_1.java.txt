VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Password Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a hardcoded password ("Mew!") that is used to verify administrative access. This is a significant security vulnerability as anyone with access to the code can obtain the password and gain unauthorized administrative privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to store passwords securely using a strong hashing algorithm and salt. The password should not be stored in plaintext within the code. A better approach would be to store hashed passwords in a secure location, such as a separate file or database. When verifying the password, the provided password should be hashed using the same algorithm and then compared to the stored hashed password. This approach ensures that passwords are not directly accessible even if the code is compromised.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {
  if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {
    return(0)
  } // Diagnostic Mode
  return(1);
}
```
