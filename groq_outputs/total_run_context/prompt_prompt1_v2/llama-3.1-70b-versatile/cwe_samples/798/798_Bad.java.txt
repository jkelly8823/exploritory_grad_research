VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a Hardcoded Credentials vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses hardcoded credentials ("scott" and "tiger") to connect to a database. This means that anyone who has access to this code will have access to the database credentials. Hardcoded credentials are a significant security risk, as they can be easily compromised by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secrets management system to store database credentials. These credentials should never be hardcoded in the code. 

Here's an example of how to use environment variables in Java:

```java
String databaseUsername = System.getenv("DB_USERNAME");
String databasePassword = System.getenv("DB_PASSWORD");
DriverManager.getConnection(url, databaseUsername, databasePassword);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
DriverManager.getConnection(url, "scott", "tiger");
