VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a vulnerability related to out-of-bounds memory access.

EXPLANATION:
The code multiplies the value pointed to by **trusted_ptr by 4096, which gives a large index value, and uses this index to access the array. However, there is no guarantee that the resulting index is within the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow, allowing attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code.

Furthermore, **trusted_ptr is not a trusted value in the context of the given code. If the value it points to is influenced by an untrusted source, then the "trusted" designation is a misnomer, and using it without validation is insecure.

Additionally, assigning untrusted_arg to *arg_copy without validation also presents a potential issue if *arg_copy is used without proper handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the index value before using it to access the array. 
- Ensure **trusted_ptr points to a trusted value or validate its contents.
- Ensure untrusted_arg is validated before being assigned to *arg_copy and used.
- Implement bounds checking on the array access.
- Use safer functions to handle memory operations, such as array index access.

ORIGINAL CODE:
void call_victim(size_t untrusted_arg) {
  *arg_copy = untrusted_arg;
  array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];
}
