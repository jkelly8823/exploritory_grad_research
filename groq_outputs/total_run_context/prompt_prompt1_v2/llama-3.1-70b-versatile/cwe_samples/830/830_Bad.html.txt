VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Insecure External Script
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the inclusion of an external JavaScript file from an untrusted source ("externalDomain.example.com/weatherwidget.js"). This makes it possible for the external domain to inject malicious scripts into the website. If the external domain is compromised or malicious, this can lead to a range of security issues including data theft and malware distribution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider one or more of the following options:

1. **Validate the script source**: Verify that the external domain is trusted and secure before loading the script.
2. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a Content Security Policy to dictate which sources of content are allowed to be executed within a web page. This can help prevent malicious scripts from being injected into the website.
3. **Host the script internally**: Instead of sourcing the script from an external domain, consider hosting it internally to reduce the risk of XSS.
4. **Use a Subresource Integrity (SRI) attribute**: Add an SRI attribute to the script tag to ensure that the script loaded has not been tampered with.
