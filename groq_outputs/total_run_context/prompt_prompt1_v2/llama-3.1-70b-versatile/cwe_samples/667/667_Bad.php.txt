VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and Unintended Direct Object Reference Vulnerability due to hardcoded file path.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses a hardcoded file path to write to the log file. This presents two potential issues. Firstly, it could be possible for an attacker to exploit the code by providing a message that contains malicious payload. However, a more severe vulnerability is the hardcoded file path itself. This allows an attacker to deduce the directory structure of the application and potentially cause more significant problems. For example, if an attacker could manipulate the filename or path, it could lead to writing to sensitive areas of the system.

Additionally, there is an issue with the fclose statement, where the variable $logfile is not correctly capitalized as $logFile. 

Moreover, using fopen and fwrite in PHP is susceptible to Path Traversal attacks. Using a harder to manipulate logging mechanism such as syslog could be more beneficial in preventing these types of vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement more robust method of logging such as using the error_log function or a framework provided logging mechanism.
2. Use a more robust file handling mechanism such as file_put_contents or a logging library to reduce chances of file-based attacks.
3. Correctly capitalize the $logfile variable in the fclose statement.
4. Consider validation and sanitization for user-provided input before writing to the log file to reduce the risk of malicious payload being written.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
function writeToLog($message){$logfile = fopen("logFile.log", "a");
                        //attempt to get logfile lock
                        if (flock($logfile, LOCK_EX)) {fwrite($logfile,$message);
                           // unlock logfile
                           flock($logfile, LOCK_UN);}else {print "Could not obtain lock on logFile.log, message not recorded\n";}}fclose($logFile);
