VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a simple and correct implementation of a mutual exclusion block using a pthread mutex. The mutex is properly locked before accessing a shared resource and unlocked afterward, preventing concurrent access to the shared resource. There are no evident issues or potential security vulnerabilities in the given code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required, as the code seems to be correctly handling the mutual exclusion logic.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
        
        /* access shared resource */
        
        
    pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
```
