VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No significant vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a part of a database query operation. It establishes a connection to a database, creates a SQL query, and attempts to execute it. Although the code does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during database operations, such as connection failures or invalid data, the main focus of this analysis is on standard vulnerabilities like SQL injection. 

The use of parameterized queries (`SqlCommand` with `Parameters.AddWithValue`) is a good practice, as it mitigates the risk of SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user input is not intermixed with the SQL code. 

However, it is worth noting that `AddWithValue` should be used with caution, as it can lead to type mismatches between the parameter and the database column, potentially causing performance issues or errors. It's generally recommended to explicitly specify the data type when adding parameters to a SQL command.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Handle potential exceptions that may occur during database operations.
- Consider explicitly specifying the data type when adding parameters to a SQL command.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
conn = new SqlConnection(_ConnectionString);
conn.Open();
int16 id = System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text);
SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id);
SqlDataReader objReader = objCommand.ExecuteReader();
