VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability exists in the memory allocation for a wide character string. Although the corrected version is present later, the initial allocation without the null-terminating character is still present.

EXPLANATION:
The code initially allocates memory for a wide character string using `wcslen(wideString) * sizeof(wchar_t)`. This is incorrect because `wcslen` returns the number of wide characters in the string, excluding the null-terminating character. Later, the code is corrected to `malloc((wcslen(wideString) + 1) * sizeof(wchar_t))`, which adds an additional byte for the null-terminating character.

Although the corrected version exists in the code snippet, having the initial incorrect allocation can still pose a risk if used elsewhere in the code or if the `malloc` statements are reordered.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the initial incorrect allocation should be removed, and only the corrected allocation should be retained:

```c
newString = (wchar_t *) malloc((wcslen(wideString) + 1) * sizeof(wchar_t));
```

Additionally, ensure that `newString` is checked for `NULL` after the `malloc` call to prevent potential null pointer dereferences.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <wchar.h>

int main() {

    wchar_t wideString[] = L"The spazzy orange tiger jumped " "over the tawny jaguar.";
    wchar_t *newString;

    printf("Strlen() output: %d\nWcslen() output: %d\n", strlen(wideString), wcslen(wideString));

    /* Wrong because the number of chars in a string isn't related to its length in bytes */
    //newString = (wchar_t *) malloc(strlen(wideString));

    /* Wrong because wide characters aren't 1 byte long! */
    //newString = (wchar_t *) malloc(wcslen(wideString));

    /* Wrong because wcslen does not include the terminating null */
    newString = (wchar_t *) malloc(wcslen(wideString) * sizeof(wchar_t));

    /* correct! */
    newString = (wchar_t *) malloc((wcslen(wideString) + 1) * sizeof(wchar_t));

    /* ... */
}
