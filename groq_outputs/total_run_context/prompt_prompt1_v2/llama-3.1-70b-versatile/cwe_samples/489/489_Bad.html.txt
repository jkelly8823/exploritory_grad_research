VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Form Submission ( Plaintext Credentials and Missing HTTPS)

EXPLANATION: 
The provided HTML form submission is vulnerable to several security issues. Firstly, it does not specify the encryption method for transmitting user credentials, which allows for communication over HTTP by default. This means that passwords and usernames will be sent in plaintext, making it easy for an attacker to intercept and steal the credentials using a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. Secondly, the `ACTION` attribute points to a CGI script (`authenticate_login.cgi`), which is often outdated and can introduce additional vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix these vulnerabilities, the following steps should be taken:

1. Update the form to use the HTTPS protocol by modifying the `ACTION` attribute to include the secure protocol, or better yet, use a relative URL to avoid hardcoding the protocol or domain name.
2. Consider updating the server-side script to use a more modern and secure method of authentication.
3. Verify that the form is correctly configured to use the HTTPS protocol by checking the server configuration to serve the login page over HTTPS.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<FORM ACTION="/authenticate_login.cgi">
  <INPUT TYPE=TEXT name=username>
  <INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD name=password>
  <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT>
</FORM>
```

Note: Due to the limitations of the provided code snippet, it's impossible to provide a complete secure solution. However, implementing secure coding practices, keeping software up-to-date, and using secure encryption methods can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches.
