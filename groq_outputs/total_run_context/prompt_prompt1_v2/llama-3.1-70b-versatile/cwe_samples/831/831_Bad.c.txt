VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Signal Handling

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the `signal` function to register a custom signal handler for `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`. However, the `signal` function is not thread-safe, and its behavior is also not well-defined if the signal occurs while the signal handler is being installed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or even crashes.

Moreover, if the signal handler itself raises another signal (e.g., by calling `abort` or `kill`), the program can enter an infinite recursion. Modern programs should use `sigaction` instead of `signal` to register signal handlers, as `sigaction` provides more fine-grained control over signal handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the `signal` calls with `sigaction` to register signal handlers. Here's an example of how to do this:
```cpp
struct sigaction sa;
sa.sa_handler = handler;
sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
sa.sa_flags = 0;
if (sigaction(SIGUSR1, &sa, NULL) < 0) {
    // Handle error
}
if (sigaction(SIGUSR2, &sa, NULL) < 0) {
    // Handle error
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
                  void handler (int sigNum) {...}
                     int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {signal(SIGUSR1, handler)signal(SIGUSR2, handler)}
