VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains an invalid write operation (repaint function call with unvalidated user input) due to the use of unvalidated input variable 'aN' and 'bN' in the default case, potentially allowing for arbitrary rendering or drawing.
EXPLANATION:
The given code contains a switch statement that assigns values to 'aN' and 'bN' based on the value of 'ctl'. However, in the default case, both 'aN' and 'bN' are set to '-1'. The code then immediately calls 'repaint(aN, bN)'. In the default case, passing '-1' to 'repaint' could lead to undefined behavior or allow an attacker to trigger unwanted rendering or other side effects depending on what the 'repaint' function is intended to do. It is essential to address this issue by applying proper validation for 'aN' and 'bN' before passing them to 'repaint'.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add validation checks to ensure 'aN' and 'bN' are within a valid range before calling 'repaint(aN, bN)'.
- In the default case, consider handling this case by throwing an exception, returning an error value, or taking other measures to handle the unexpected value.
- Consider changing the data type of 'aN' and 'bN' from signed to unsigned int if they are meant to hold positive values only.

ORIGINAL CODE:

int aN, Bn;switch (ctl) {
        case -1:aN = 0;bN = 0;break;
           case 0:aN = i;bN = -i;break;
           case 1:aN = i + NEXT_SZ;bN = i - NEXT_SZ;break;
           default:aN = -1;aN = -1;break;
        
}repaint(aN, bN);
