VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Infinite Recursion Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a function `do_something_recursive` which calls itself recursively based on the value of the input parameter `flg`. The issue arises from the fact that the value of `flg` is never modified within the recursive function. As a result, if the initial value of `flg` is non-zero, the recursive calls will continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow. This is because the function never meets the base case required for recursive termination.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the recursive function `do_something_recursive` should be modified to have a base case that terminates the recursion. This can be achieved by modifying the value of `flg` within the function or by introducing a separate condition to break the recursion. Additionally, it would be beneficial to validate the initial value of `flg` before calling the recursive function to prevent potential stack overflow. Here's a possible fix:

```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    // Do some real work here
    if (flg > 0) { do_something_recursive (flg - 1); } // Introduce a decrementing counter to terminate the recursion
}

flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
if (flag > 0) {
    do_something_recursive (flag);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    ... // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // flg is never modified so it is always TRUE - this call will continue until the stack explodes
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
