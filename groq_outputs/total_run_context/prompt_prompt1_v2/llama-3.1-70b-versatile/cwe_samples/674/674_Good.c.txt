VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Stack Overflow due to Infinite Recursion.
EXPLANATION:
The do_something_recursive function calls itself without properly checking the input condition. In this case, the function is only recursive when flg is non-zero. However, the input value flg is not checked or validated before being passed to the recursive call. Furthermore, the recursive call does not modify the value of flg in a way that guarantees the recursion will eventually terminate.

The reason for this potential vulnerability is that the recursive call happens inside an if condition without actually decrementing the value of flg. If the input value of flg is non-zero, the function will continue to call itself without terminating, leading to a potential stack overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the recursive call has a base case that guarantees termination. 
   This can be achieved by properly checking the input value and decrementing it before the recursive call.
2. Validate the input value flg before passing it to the recursive call to prevent any potential stack overflow.

RECOMMENDED CODE:
```c
    void do_something_recursive (int flg)
    {
      if (flg <= 0) {
        return;  // base case: exit recursion when flg is 0 or less
      }
      
      ... // Do some real work here
      do_something_recursive (flg-1);  // decrement flg in each recursive call
    }
 
    int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
    do_something_recursive (flag);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
    void do_something_recursive (int flg)
    {
      ... // Do some real work here
      // Modify value of flg on done condition
      if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // returns when flg changes to 0
    }
    int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
    do_something_recursive (flag);
```
