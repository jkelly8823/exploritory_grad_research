VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds data access with variable data_in_security_level.

EXPLANATION:
The data_in_security_level port of the u_tz_peripheral module is driven by the rdata_security_level signal. However, the snippet provided does not define or check the bounds of this signal. Without knowing the definition of rdata_security_level, there's a possibility that it might take on a value outside the valid range for data_in_security_level, potentially leading to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, ensure that the rdata_security_level signal is properly validated before assigning it to data_in_security_level. Consider adding input validation or error checking to prevent invalid values from being propagated through the system.
Additionally, it's recommended to include bounds checking in the module that assigns the rdata_security_level signal to ensure that it falls within the valid range for data_in_security_level.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  // Instantiation of IP in a parent system
                  module soc(...)
                  
                  ...
                  tz_peripheral u_tz_peripheral(
                  
                    .clk(clk),
                    .rst(rst),
                    .data_in(rdata),
                    // This port is no longer grounded, but instead driven by the appropriate signal
                    .data_in_security_level(rdata_security_level),
                  
                  );
                  ...
                  
                  endmodule
