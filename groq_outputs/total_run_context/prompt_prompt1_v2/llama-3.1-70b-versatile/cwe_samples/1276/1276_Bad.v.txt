VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded security level value could potentially lead to security misconfiguration or loss of data integrity.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a Verilog module definition and instantiation in a larger System-on-Chip (SoC) design. In this instantiation, the 'data_in_security_level' port is hardcoded to a value of 0, which is intended to represent the "secure" security level.

However, a closer examination of the hardcoded value reveals a potential security vulnerability. If the security level is always set to 0 (secure) in this module, an attacker could exploit this to bypass security checks and maliciously elevate the security level of sensitive data.

Moreover, in the presence of other security controls that are dependent on this security level (for example, in a TrustZone-enabled system), hardcoding this value could allow an attacker to bypass or breach those controls.

It is also possible that this hardcoding is the result of a copy-and-paste error or typo, where the developer intended to set this value based on the actual security level of the input data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, we recommend dynamically determining the security level value based on the actual security level of the input data. This can be achieved by assigning the 'data_in_security_level' port to a variable that reflects the correct security level.

For example:
tz_peripheral u_tz_peripheral(
  .clk(clk),
  .rst(rst),
  .data_in(rdata),
  .data_in_security_level(actual_security_level),
);
...

Additionally, we recommend implementing input validation and sanitization checks to ensure that the 'actual_security_level' value is within the allowed range and has not been tampered with.

ORIGINAL CODE:

// IP definition
module tz_peripheral(clk, reset, data_in, data_in_security_level, ...);
      
input clk, reset;
input [31:0] data_in;
input data_in_security_level;
...
      
endmodule
// Instantiation of IP in a parent system
module soc(...)
...
tz_peripheral u_tz_peripheral(
  
  .clk(clk),
  .rst(rst),
  .data_in(rdata),
  //Copy-and-paste error or typo grounds data_in_security_level (in this example 0=secure, 1=non-secure) effectively promoting all data to "secure")
  .data_in_security_level(1'b0),
  
);
...
      
endmodule
