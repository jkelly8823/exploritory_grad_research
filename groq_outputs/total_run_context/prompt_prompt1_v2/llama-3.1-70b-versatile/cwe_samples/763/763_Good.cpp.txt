VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability and a memory leak vulnerability in the event of an exception.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is vulnerable to use-after-free and memory leak issues if an exception occurs between the time `ptr` is allocated and when it's deleted. Since C++ doesn't have built-in garbage collection or automatic memory management, it's the programmer's responsibility to properly clean up dynamically allocated memory. 

The current code does not properly handle the case where an exception occurs, potentially leaving the dynamically allocated memory unfreed. In addition, if an exception is thrown after `ptr` is used (between the `new` and `delete` operations) but before `delete` can be called, it will result in a memory leak.

Furthermore, if another function is called between the allocation and deallocation of `ptr` and it reuses or accesses the same memory location, this can also lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider using a smart pointer such as `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to automatically manage the lifetime of `ptr`. These classes ensure that the memory is properly deallocated even in the event of an exception.

Modified Code Snippet Using `std::unique_ptr`:

```cpp
void foo(){
    std::unique_ptr<BarObj> ptr = std::make_unique<BarObj>();
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
} // ptr is automatically deleted at the end of the scope
```

Modified Code Snippet Using `std::shared_ptr`:

```cpp
void foo(){
    std::shared_ptr<BarObj> ptr = std::make_shared<BarObj>();
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
} // ptr is automatically deleted when the reference count reaches zero
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
       /* do some work with ptr here */
       
       ...
       delete ptr;
}
```
