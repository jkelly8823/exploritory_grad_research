VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-after-free vulnerability and potential null pointer dereference vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, a string is dynamically allocated using `malloc()`. This string is then modified and potentially freed before the loop iterates again, resulting in undefined behavior since the `strlen()` and `str[i]` operations attempt to access memory that has been freed. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.

Additionally, in the case where `malloc()` fails and returns `NULL`, the string is still assigned to `str` and subsequent calls to `strcpy()` and `strlen()` may result in a null pointer dereference.

It is also worth noting that using `strlen()` in the loop condition may result in inefficient code since `strlen()` has to traverse the string to find its length on each iteration. However, this is more of a performance issue than a security vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to avoid the use-after-free situation. This can be achieved by removing the `free(str);return SUCCESS;` line from the loop and only freeing the string after the loop. Here's the modified code:

```
int cointains_char(char c){
    char *str;int i = 0;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, "Search Me!");while( i < strlen(str) ){
        if( str[i] == c ){
            free(str);return SUCCESS;
        }
        i = i + 1;
    }
    free(str);return FAILURE;
}
```

However, it would be even better to avoid using `strlen()` in the loop condition. Here's a more efficient version:

```
int cointains_char(char c){
    char *str;int i = 0;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, "Search Me!");int len = strlen(str);while( i < len ){
        if( str[i] == c ){
            free(str);return SUCCESS;
        }
        i = i + 1;
    }
    free(str);return FAILURE;
}
```

Additionally, to fix the potential null pointer dereference vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `malloc()`:

```
int cointains_char(char c){
    char *str;int i = 0;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));if (str == NULL) { return FAILURE; }strcpy(str, "Search Me!");int len = strlen(str);while( i < len ){
        if( str[i] == c ){
            free(str);return SUCCESS;
        }
        i = i + 1;
    }
    free(str);return FAILURE;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)
int cointains_char(char c){
    char *str;int i = 0;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, "Search Me!");while( i < strlen(str) ){
          if( str[i] == c ){
                
                /* matched char, free string and return success */
                free(str);return SUCCESS;
          }
          /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
          i = i + 1;
    }
    /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
    free(str);return FAILURE;
}
```
