VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Double-Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment allocates memory for a `BarObj` using `new` and assigns it to the `ptr` pointer. However, it is then explicitly freed using `free()`. This is a double-free vulnerability because `new` allocates memory but `free()` is used to deallocate, which is incorrect in this context.

In C++, when memory is allocated using `new`, it should be deallocated using `delete`. Using `free()` instead can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes. This vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker can manipulate the `ptr` variable before it is freed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, replace the line `free(ptr);` with `delete ptr;`. This ensures that the memory is correctly deallocated using the correct operator for the allocation method used.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    free(ptr);
}
```

Corrected Code:
```c++
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    delete ptr;
}
```
