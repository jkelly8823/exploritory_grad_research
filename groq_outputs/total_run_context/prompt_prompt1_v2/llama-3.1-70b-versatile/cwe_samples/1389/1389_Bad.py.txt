VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code is vulnerable to a subprocess injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: 
The subprocess.call() function in the run_ping function does not properly sanitize the input validated IP address. If an attacker provides a specially crafted IP address that includes shell command injection characters, they could potentially inject malicious commands to the operating system command line. Although the validate_ip function validates the input IP address format, it does not prevent a command injection attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, use the subprocess module with the 'shlex' module to split the command and arguments into individual strings before passing them to subprocess.call(). This can help prevent any injection attacks by making it harder to inject special characters.

Here is a corrected version of the run_ping function:

```python
import subprocess
import shlex

...

def run_ping(ip: str):
  validated = validate_ip(ip)
  # Use shlex to split the command and arguments
  ping_args = shlex.split("ping " + validated)
  subprocess.call(ping_args)
  return
```

Alternatively, consider using Python's built-in 'subprocess' module's 'check_output' function, and also be sure to check the result.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```python
import subprocess

def validate_ip(ip: str):

  split_ip = ip.split('.')
  if len(split_ip) > 4 or len(split_ip) == 0:

    raise ValueError("Invalid IP length")

  
  for octet in split_ip:

    try:
    
      int(octet, 10)
    
    except ValueError as e:
    
      raise ValueError(f"Cannot convert IP octet to int - {e}")
  

  # Returns original IP after ensuring no exceptions are raised
  return ip



def run_ping(ip: str):

  validated = validate_ip(ip)
  # The ping command treats zero-prepended IP addresses as octal
  result = subprocess.call(["ping", validated])
  print(result)
```
