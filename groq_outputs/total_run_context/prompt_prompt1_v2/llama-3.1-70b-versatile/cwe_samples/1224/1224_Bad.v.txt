VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a Verilog module for a write-once register. It uses a "Write_once_status" flag to prevent Data_out from being overwritten once it has been written. 
Upon analyzing this code snippet, I found no apparent vulnerabilities that could lead to security risks or unforeseen behavior. 
This module is properly handling the reset states and setting the Write_once_status flag correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommended fixes are provided as the code appears to be secure and functioning as intended.
ORIGINAL CODE:
                      module register_write_once_example
		      ( 
		      input [15:0] Data_in, 
		      input Clk, 
		      input ip_resetn, 
		      input global_resetn,
		      input write,
		      output reg [15:0] Data_out 
		      );
		      
		      reg Write_once_status; 
                      
		      always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip_resetn)
		      
			if (~ip_resetn)
			begin
			
			  Data_out <= 16'h0000;
			  Write_once_status <= 1'b0; 
			
			end 
			else if (write & ~Write_once_status)
			begin
			
			  Data_out <= Data_in & 16'hFFFE;
			  Write_once_status <= Data_in[0]; // Input bit 0 sets Write_once_status
			
			end
			else if (~write)
			begin 
			
			  Data_out[15:1] <= Data_out[15:1]; 
			  Data_out[0] <= Write_once_status; 
			
			end 
			
			endmodule
