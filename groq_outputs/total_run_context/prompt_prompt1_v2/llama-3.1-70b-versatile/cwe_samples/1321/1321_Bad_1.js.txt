VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a prototype pollution attack, which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

EXPLANATION:
The `setValueByPath` function is used to set a value in an object by specifying a path to the property. However, in this case, the path contains the string `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`, which refers to the object's prototype property. When assigning a value to `__proto__.isAdmin` or `constructor.prototype.isAdmin`, an attacker could potentially pollute the prototype chain of the object, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

In the first line, `__proto__.isAdmin` can be used to pollute the prototype chain of the object, where `__proto__` refers to the object's prototype property. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if the polluted prototype chain is later used to create new objects or access existing objects.

In the second line, `constructor.prototype.isAdmin` can also be used to pollute the prototype chain, but by accessing the `prototype` property through the `constructor` property of an object. This can be more difficult to detect but still poses a significant threat.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent prototype pollution attacks, ensure that the `setValueByPath` function is not used with user-provided input that contains `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` references. Additionally, consider adding input validation to prevent such paths from being used.

To fix this vulnerability, consider adding a check in the `setValueByPath` function to prevent setting values on the prototype chain:

```javascript
function setValueByPath(obj, path, value) {
  const pathParts = path.split('.');
  const lastPart = pathParts.pop();

  let currentObj = obj;

  for (let part of pathParts) {
    if (part === '__proto__' || part.includes('constructor.prototype')) {
      throw new Error('Setting values on the prototype chain is not allowed');
    }
    currentObj = currentObj[part];
  }

  currentObj[lastPart] = value;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
  setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)
  setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
```
