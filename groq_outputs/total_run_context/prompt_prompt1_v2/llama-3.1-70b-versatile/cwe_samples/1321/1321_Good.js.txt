VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Object Deserialization via Prototype Pollution.

EXPLANATION: 
This function is vulnerable to prototype pollution because it does not properly validate the `attr` variable in the `pathArray`. Although it checks for `"__proto__"`, `"constructor"`, and `"prototype"`, it does not account for other attributes that may lead to prototype pollution. A malicious user could craft a `path` that includes attributes which will be serialized into the object's prototype chain, effectively polluting the prototype and leading to potential code injection or data tampering.

Moreover, the function sets `objectToModify[attr]` to an empty object if `objectToModify[attr]` is not an object, without validating if the attribute already exists on the object's prototype chain. This further increases the likelihood of a successful prototype pollution attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Use a more robust validation mechanism for attributes to prevent prototype pollution.
- Implement a deep freeze on the object's prototype chain to prevent modification.
- Be cautious when accepting inputs from untrusted sources.
- Use a safer method for object modification, such as using a library that has built-in protection against prototype pollution.
- Perform additional validation and sanitization on the `path` variable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
function setValueByPath (object, path, value) {
    
    const pathArray = path.split(".");
    const attributeToSet = pathArray.pop();
    let objectToModify = object;
    for (const attr of pathArray) {

        // Ignore attributes which resolve to object prototype
        if (attr === "__proto__" || attr === "constructor" || attr === "prototype") {

            continue;
        }

        if (typeof objectToModify[attr] !== "object") {

            objectToModify[attr] = {};
        }

        objectToModify = objectToModify[attr];
    }

    objectToModify[attributeToSet] = value;
    return object;
}
```
