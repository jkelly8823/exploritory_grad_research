VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it takes untrusted user input ($Username) and uses it to construct a file path. Although the code attempts to mitigate this by removing '../' from the input using the line `$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;`, this is insufficient to prevent a path traversal attack. The user could still enter a path that navigates outside the intended directory by using techniques such as '/./', '/.././', or using Unicode characters that get decoded to '../' after being processed.

Furthermore, the code does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input to ensure it matches expected formats.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following steps should be taken:
- Perform comprehensive validation and sanitization of user input to ensure it only contains authorized characters and adheres to expected formats.
- Use a whitelist-based approach to only allow specific, trusted input.
- Avoid using user input to construct paths directly; instead, use a mapping or a directory structure that does not allow traversal outside a designated directory.
- Use a secure and trusted library or framework to construct and work with file paths.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
