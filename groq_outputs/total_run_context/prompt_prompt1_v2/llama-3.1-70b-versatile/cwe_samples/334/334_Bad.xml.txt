VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insufficient Session ID Length

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet sets the session ID length to 8 bytes. However, this value may be too low and could allow for session ID brute forcing or collisions. According to OWASP, the recommended minimum session ID length is 128 bits (16 bytes) to prevent session ID guessing attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Increase the session ID length to at least 16 bytes to prevent session ID guessing attacks. The value of "idLengthBytes" should be changed to a minimum of 16.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <sun-web-app>
                        ...<session-config>
                              <session-properties><property name="idLengthBytes" value="8"><description>The number of bytes in this web module's session ID.</description></property></session-properties>
                           </session-config>...
                     </sun-web-app>
