VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded IP Address.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a hardcoded IP address (32'hF00) which can potentially introduce security risks. Hardcoding IP addresses can limit the flexibility of the system and can lead to vulnerabilities if the address is not properly validated. In a production environment, IP addresses should be configurable or dynamically obtained to avoid potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider replacing the hardcoded IP address with a configurable value or a dynamically obtained IP address. This can be achieved by introducing a new variable or a constant that can be set at runtime or through a configuration file.

Additionally, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the IP address to ensure it falls within a valid range and is properly formatted. Consider using IP validation libraries or functions to perform this validation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00) ? 1: 0;
