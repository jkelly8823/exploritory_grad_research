VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Infinite Recursion Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains a clear example of infinite recursion, where two methods call each other without any termination condition. This can lead to a stack overflow error and ultimately result in a denial of service. In this case, `doTweedledee` calls `doTweedledumb`, and `doTweedledumb` calls `doTweedledee`, creating an infinite loop.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that there is a termination condition in place to prevent infinite recursion. This can be achieved by introducing a loop counter or a conditional check that stops the recursion once the desired condition is met. Alternatively, the methods can be rewritten to avoid recursive calls altogether.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public class DoubleDead {private void doTweedledee() {doTweedledumb();}private void doTweedledumb() {doTweedledee();}public static void main(String[] args) {System.out.println("running DoubleDead");}}
