VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Handling of Intent Extras
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet registers a BroadcastReceiver that listens for an intent with the action "com.example.RemoveUser". When this intent is received, the BroadcastReceiver attempts to retrieve an extra value from the intent using the getIntExtra method and then calls the destroyUserData method with this ID.

However, there is no validation on the extracted userID value before it is used to destroy user data. Additionally, the permission checks for this intent are not shown in this code snippet, but the fact that it does not check the sender of the intent makes it vulnerable to arbitrary intent attacks.

An attacker could potentially send a custom intent with a malicious userID value, causing the app to destroy unintended data or potentially lead to further security issues.

If this receiver is exported in the app's manifest (which is not shown in this code snippet), it may be vulnerable to third-party apps sending this intent, allowing for the deletion of user data without user interaction.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the extracted userID value to ensure it is valid and within expected ranges.
- Implement permission checking for the intent sender to ensure that only authorized components can send this intent.
- Consider using a more secure data storage and deletion mechanism.
- Ensure the receiver is not exported if it only needs to receive intents from within the app.
- Use a more explicit intent like a PendingIntent with a specific action, and verify the intent in the onReceive method.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();registerReceiver(receiver, filter);

public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
        destroyUserData(userID);
    }
}
```
