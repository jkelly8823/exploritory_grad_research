VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential DOM-based injection through malformed query string in URL.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in line 8, where the `writeDataToView` method takes the `[URL query]` parameter directly from the `NSURLRequest`. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious URL that includes a query string that injects malicious code or data into the webview. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript or manipulate the DOM.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the `[URL query]` parameter before passing it to the `writeDataToView` method. This can be achieved by checking the structure and contents of the query string and ensuring that it does not contain any malicious or unexpected data. Additionally, consider using a more secure method of data exchange between the webview and native code, such as postMessage or window.postMessage.

ORIGINAL CODE:


// iOS
-(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
        NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
            // Make data available back in webview.
            UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
            return NO;
        }
        return YES;
    }
}
